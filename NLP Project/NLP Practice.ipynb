The resulting\\r\\netext was compared with a public domain hard copy version of the text.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn chapters 24, 89, and 90, we substituted a capital L for the symbol\\r\\nfor the British pound, a unit of currency.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nETYMOLOGY. (Supplied by a Late Consumptive Usher to a Grammar School.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe pale Usher\\u2014threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him\\r\\nnow. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer\\r\\nhandkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all\\r\\nthe known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it\\r\\nsomehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhile you take in hand to school others, and to teach them by what\\r\\nname a whale-fish is to be called in our tongue, leaving out, through\\r\\nignorance, the letter H, which almost alone maketh up the signification\\r\\nof the word, you deliver that which is not true.\\u201d \\u2014Hackluyt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWHALE. * * * Sw. and Dan. hval.

(Supplied by a Sub-Sub-Librarian).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a\\r\\npoor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans\\r\\nand street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to\\r\\nwhales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or\\r\\nprofane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the\\r\\nhiggledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these\\r\\nextracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the\\r\\nancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these\\r\\nextracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing\\r\\nbird\\u2019s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied,\\r\\nand sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our\\r\\nown.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou\\r\\nbelongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world\\r\\nwill ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong;\\r\\nbut with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too;\\r\\nand grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes\\r\\nand empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness\\u2014Give\\r\\nit up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the\\r\\nworld, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that\\r\\nI could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye!

Loomings.\\r\\n\\r\\nCall me Ishmael. Some years ago\\u2014never mind how long precisely\\u2014having\\r\\nlittle or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on\\r\\nshore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of\\r\\nthe world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating\\r\\nthe circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;\\r\\nwhenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find\\r\\nmyself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up\\r\\nthe rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get\\r\\nsuch an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to\\r\\nprevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically\\r\\nknocking people\\u2019s hats off\\u2014then, I account it high time to get to\\r\\nsea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With\\r\\na philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly\\r\\ntake to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew\\r\\nit, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very\\r\\nnearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\\r\\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs\\u2014commerce surrounds it with\\r\\nher surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme\\r\\ndowntown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and\\r\\ncooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land.\\r\\nLook at the crowds of water-gazers there.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears\\r\\nHook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What\\r\\ndo you see?\\u2014Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand\\r\\nthousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some\\r\\nleaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some\\r\\nlooking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the\\r\\nrigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these\\r\\nare all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster\\u2014tied to\\r\\ncounters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are\\r\\nthe green fields gone? What do they here?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\\r\\nseemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the\\r\\nextremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder\\r\\nwarehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water\\r\\nas they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand\\u2014miles of\\r\\nthem\\u2014leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets\\r\\nand avenues\\u2014north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite.\\r\\nTell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all\\r\\nthose ships attract them thither?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take\\r\\nalmost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a\\r\\ndale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic\\r\\nin it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest\\r\\nreveries\\u2014stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he\\r\\nwill infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.\\r\\nShould you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this\\r\\nexperiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical\\r\\nprofessor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for\\r\\never.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,\\r\\nquietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of\\r\\nthe Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,\\r\\neach with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and\\r\\nhere sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder\\r\\ncottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a\\r\\nmazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their\\r\\nhill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though\\r\\nthis pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd\\u2019s\\r\\nhead, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\\u2019s eye were fixed upon the\\r\\nmagic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores\\r\\non scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies\\u2014what is the\\r\\none charm wanting?\\u2014Water\\u2014there is not a drop of water there! Were\\r\\nNiagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to\\r\\nsee it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two\\r\\nhandfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly\\r\\nneeded, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why\\r\\nis almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at\\r\\nsome time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a\\r\\npassenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first\\r\\ntold that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the\\r\\nold Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate\\r\\ndeity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning.\\r\\nAnd still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because\\r\\nhe could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain,\\r\\nplunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see\\r\\nin all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of\\r\\nlife; and this is the key to it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin\\r\\nto grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs,\\r\\nI do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger.\\r\\nFor to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is\\r\\nbut a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get\\r\\nsea-sick\\u2014grow quarrelsome\\u2014don\\u2019t sleep of nights\\u2014do not enjoy\\r\\nthemselves much, as a general thing;\\u2014no, I never go as a passenger;\\r\\nnor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a\\r\\nCommodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction\\r\\nof such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all\\r\\nhonourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind\\r\\nwhatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,\\r\\nwithout taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.\\r\\nAnd as for going as cook,\\u2014though I confess there is considerable glory\\r\\nin that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board\\u2014yet, somehow,\\r\\nI never fancied broiling fowls;\\u2014though once broiled, judiciously\\r\\nbuttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who\\r\\nwill speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled\\r\\nfowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old\\r\\nEgyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the\\r\\nmummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\\r\\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\\r\\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\\r\\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort\\r\\nof thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one\\u2019s sense of honour,\\r\\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the\\r\\nVan Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all,\\r\\nif just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been\\r\\nlording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand\\r\\nin awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a\\r\\nschoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and\\r\\nthe Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in\\r\\ntime.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom\\r\\nand sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,\\r\\nI mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel\\r\\nGabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and\\r\\nrespectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who\\r\\nain\\u2019t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains\\r\\nmay order me about\\u2014however they may thump and punch me about, I have\\r\\nthe satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is\\r\\none way or other served in much the same way\\u2014either in a physical\\r\\nor metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is\\r\\npassed round, and all hands should rub each other\\u2019s shoulder-blades,\\r\\nand be content.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\\r\\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\\r\\npenny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must\\r\\npay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying\\r\\nand being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable\\r\\ninfliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But being\\r\\npaid,\\u2014what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man\\r\\nreceives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly\\r\\nbelieve money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account\\r\\ncan a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves\\r\\nto perdition!\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\\r\\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,\\r\\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is,\\r\\nif you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\\r\\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\\r\\nthe sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not\\r\\nso. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many\\r\\nother things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.\\r\\nBut wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a\\r\\nmerchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling\\r\\nvoyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the\\r\\nconstant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in\\r\\nsome unaccountable way\\u2014he can better answer than any one else. And,\\r\\ndoubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand\\r\\nprogramme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as\\r\\na sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances.\\r\\nI take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGrand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.\\r\\n\\u201cWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. \\u201cBLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the\\r\\nFates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others\\r\\nwere set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and\\r\\neasy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces\\u2014though\\r\\nI cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the\\r\\ncircumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives\\r\\nwhich being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced\\r\\nme to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the\\r\\ndelusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill\\r\\nand discriminating judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great\\r\\nwhale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my\\r\\ncuriosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island\\r\\nbulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all\\r\\nthe attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped\\r\\nto sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not\\r\\nhave been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting\\r\\nitch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on\\r\\nbarbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a\\r\\nhorror, and could still be social with it\\u2014would they let me\\u2014since\\r\\nit is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place\\r\\none lodges in.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\\r\\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\\r\\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\\r\\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them\\r\\nall, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.\\r\\n\\r\\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my arm,\\r\\nand started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city of\\r\\nold Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night in\\r\\nDecember. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet\\r\\nfor Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place\\r\\nwould offer, till the following Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at\\r\\nthis same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well\\r\\nbe related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was\\r\\nmade up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a\\r\\nfine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous\\r\\nold island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has\\r\\nof late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though\\r\\nin this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket\\r\\nwas her great original\\u2014the Tyre of this Carthage;\\u2014the place\\r\\nwhere the first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from\\r\\nNantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out\\r\\nin canoes to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket,\\r\\ntoo, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden\\r\\nwith imported cobblestones\\u2014so goes the story\\u2014to throw at the whales,\\r\\nin order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from\\r\\nthe bowsprit?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before me\\r\\nin New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a\\r\\nmatter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a\\r\\nvery dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold\\r\\nand cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had\\r\\nsounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\\u2014So,\\r\\nwherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of\\r\\na dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the\\r\\nnorth with the darkness towards the south\\u2014wherever in your wisdom you\\r\\nmay conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire\\r\\nthe price, and don\\u2019t be too particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \\u201cThe\\r\\nCrossed Harpoons\\u201d\\u2014but it looked too expensive and jolly there.\\r\\nFurther on, from the bright red windows of the \\u201cSword-Fish Inn,\\u201d\\r\\nthere came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed\\r\\nsnow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed\\r\\nfrost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,\\u2014rather weary\\r\\nfor me, when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because\\r\\nfrom hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most\\r\\nmiserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one\\r\\nmoment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of\\r\\nthe tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don\\u2019t\\r\\nyou hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are stopping\\r\\nthe way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets that\\r\\ntook me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the\\r\\ncheeriest inns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,\\r\\nand here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At\\r\\nthis hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of\\r\\nthe town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light\\r\\nproceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood invitingly\\r\\nopen. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the uses of the\\r\\npublic; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble over an\\r\\nash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying particles almost\\r\\nchoked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city, Gomorrah? But\\r\\n\\u201cThe Crossed Harpoons,\\u201d and \\u201cThe Sword-Fish?\\u201d\\u2014this, then must\\r\\nneeds be the sign of \\u201cThe Trap.\\u201d However, I picked myself up and\\r\\nhearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior\\r\\ndoor.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black\\r\\nfaces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel\\r\\nof Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the\\r\\npreacher\\u2019s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping\\r\\nand wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing\\r\\nout, Wretched entertainment at the sign of \\u2018The Trap!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks,\\r\\nand heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging\\r\\nsign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing\\r\\na tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath\\u2014\\u201cThe\\r\\nSpouter Inn:\\u2014Peter Coffin.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nCoffin?\\u2014Spouter?\\u2014Rather ominous in that particular connexion,\\r\\nthought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose\\r\\nthis Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim,\\r\\nand the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated\\r\\nlittle wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here\\r\\nfrom the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a\\r\\npoverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very\\r\\nspot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a queer sort of place\\u2014a gable-ended old house, one side palsied\\r\\nas it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,\\r\\nwhere that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever\\r\\nit did about poor Paul\\u2019s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless, is\\r\\na mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the hob\\r\\nquietly toasting for bed. \\u201cIn judging of that tempestuous wind called\\r\\nEuroclydon,\\u201d says an old writer\\u2014of whose works I possess the only\\r\\ncopy extant\\u2014\\u201cit maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou lookest\\r\\nout at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside, or\\r\\nwhether thou observest it from that sashless window, where the frost is\\r\\non both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only glazier.\\u201d\\r\\nTrue enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my mind\\u2014old\\r\\nblack-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are windows, and this\\r\\nbody of mine is the house. What a pity they didn\\u2019t stop up the chinks\\r\\nand the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint here and there. But\\r\\nit\\u2019s too late to make any improvements now. The universe is finished;\\r\\nthe copestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.\\r\\nPoor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his\\r\\npillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might plug\\r\\nup both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that\\r\\nwould not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old\\r\\nDives, in his red silken wrapper\\u2014(he had a redder one afterwards)\\r\\npooh, pooh! What a fine frosty night; how Orion glitters; what northern\\r\\nlights! Let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting\\r\\nconservatories; give me the privilege of making my own summer with my\\r\\nown coals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up\\r\\nto the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra\\r\\nthan here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the\\r\\nline of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in\\r\\norder to keep out this frost?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the\\r\\ndoor of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be\\r\\nmoored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a\\r\\nCzar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a\\r\\ntemperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is\\r\\nplenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet,\\r\\nand see what sort of a place this \\u201cSpouter\\u201d may be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\\r\\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\\r\\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large\\r\\noilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the\\r\\nunequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent\\r\\nstudy and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of\\r\\nthe neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its\\r\\npurpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first\\r\\nyou almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New\\r\\nEngland hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint\\r\\nof much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and\\r\\nespecially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the\\r\\nentry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however\\r\\nwild, might not be altogether unwarranted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber, portentous,\\r\\nblack mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three\\r\\nblue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast. A boggy,\\r\\nsoggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive a nervous man distracted.\\r\\nYet was there a sort of indefinite, half-attained, unimaginable\\r\\nsublimity about it that fairly froze you to it, till you involuntarily\\r\\ntook an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting\\r\\nmeant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas, deceptive idea would dart\\r\\nyou through.\\u2014It\\u2019s the Black Sea in a midnight gale.\\u2014It\\u2019s\\r\\nthe unnatural combat of the four primal elements.\\u2014It\\u2019s a blasted\\r\\nheath.\\u2014It\\u2019s a Hyperborean winter scene.\\u2014It\\u2019s the breaking-up of\\r\\nthe icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to\\r\\nthat one portentous something in the picture\\u2019s midst. That once found\\r\\nout, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint\\r\\nresemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the artist\\u2019s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\\r\\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom\\r\\nI conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner in a\\r\\ngreat hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its three\\r\\ndismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale, purposing to\\r\\nspring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of impaling himself\\r\\nupon the three mast-heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\\r\\narray of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with\\r\\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots of\\r\\nhuman hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping round\\r\\nlike the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed mower. You\\r\\nshuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage\\r\\ncould ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking, horrifying\\r\\nimplement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons\\r\\nall broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With this once long\\r\\nlance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen\\r\\nwhales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that harpoon\\u2014so like a\\r\\ncorkscrew now\\u2014was flung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale,\\r\\nyears afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The original iron entered\\r\\nnigh the tail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a\\r\\nman, travelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the\\r\\nhump.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way\\u2014cut\\r\\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\\r\\nfireplaces all round\\u2014you enter the public room. A still duskier place\\r\\nis this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled\\r\\nplanks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft\\u2019s\\r\\ncockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored\\r\\nold ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like\\r\\ntable covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities\\r\\ngathered from this wide world\\u2019s remotest nooks. Projecting from the\\r\\nfurther angle of the room stands a dark-looking den\\u2014the bar\\u2014a rude\\r\\nattempt at a right whale\\u2019s head. Be that how it may, there stands the\\r\\nvast arched bone of the whale\\u2019s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost\\r\\ndrive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old\\r\\ndecanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction, like\\r\\nanother cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him), bustles a\\r\\nlittle withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells the sailors\\r\\ndeliriums and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though\\r\\ntrue cylinders without\\u2014within, the villanous green goggling glasses\\r\\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians\\r\\nrudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads\\u2019 goblets. Fill\\r\\nto this mark, and your charge is but a penny; to this a penny more; and\\r\\nso on to the full glass\\u2014the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp down\\r\\nfor a shilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\\r\\na table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander. I\\r\\nsought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with\\r\\na room, received for answer that his house was full\\u2014not a bed\\r\\nunoccupied. \\u201cBut avast,\\u201d he added, tapping his forehead, \\u201cyou\\r\\nhaint no objections to sharing a harpooneer\\u2019s blanket, have ye? I\\r\\ns\\u2019pose you are goin\\u2019 a-whalin\\u2019, so you\\u2019d better get used to that\\r\\nsort of thing.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\\r\\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and\\r\\nthat if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\\r\\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\\r\\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\\r\\nthe half of any decent man\\u2019s blanket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?\\u2014you want supper?\\r\\nSupper\\u2019ll be ready directly.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\\r\\nBattery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\\r\\nhis jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\\r\\nbetween his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\\r\\nhe didn\\u2019t make much headway, I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\\r\\nadjoining room. It was cold as Iceland\\u2014no fire at all\\u2014the landlord\\r\\nsaid he couldn\\u2019t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,\\r\\neach in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets,\\r\\nand hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers.\\r\\nBut the fare was of the most substantial kind\\u2014not only meat and\\r\\npotatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young\\r\\nfellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a\\r\\nmost direful manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy boy,\\u201d said the landlord, \\u201cyou\\u2019ll have the nightmare to a\\r\\ndead sartainty.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLandlord,\\u201d I whispered, \\u201cthat aint the harpooneer is it?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, no,\\u201d said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \\u201cthe\\r\\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he\\r\\ndon\\u2019t\\u2014he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes \\u2018em rare.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe devil he does,\\u201d says I. \\u201cWhere is that harpooneer? Is he\\r\\nhere?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019ll be here afore long,\\u201d was the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \\u201cdark\\r\\ncomplexioned\\u201d harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so\\r\\nturned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into\\r\\nbed before I did.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\\r\\nwhat else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the evening\\r\\nas a looker on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\\r\\ncried, \\u201cThat\\u2019s the Grampus\\u2019s crew. I seed her reported in the\\r\\noffing this morning; a three years\\u2019 voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah,\\r\\nboys; now we\\u2019ll have the latest news from the Feegees.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,\\r\\nand in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy\\r\\nwatch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all\\r\\nbedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an\\r\\neruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat,\\r\\nand this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they\\r\\nmade a straight wake for the whale\\u2019s mouth\\u2014the bar\\u2014when the\\r\\nwrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out\\r\\nbrimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which\\r\\nJonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore\\r\\nwas a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind\\r\\nof how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on\\r\\nthe weather side of an ice-island.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\\r\\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering\\r\\nabout most obstreperously.\\r\\n\\r\\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\\r\\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own\\r\\nsober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise\\r\\nas the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods\\r\\nhad ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a\\r\\nsleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will\\r\\nhere venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet\\r\\nin height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have\\r\\nseldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,\\r\\nmaking his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep\\r\\nshadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give\\r\\nhim much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner,\\r\\nand from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall\\r\\nmountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry\\r\\nof his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away\\r\\nunobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the\\r\\nsea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and\\r\\nbeing, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised\\r\\na cry of \\u201cBulkington! Bulkington! where\\u2019s Bulkington?\\u201d and darted\\r\\nout of the house in pursuit of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now about nine o\\u2019clock, and the room seeming almost\\r\\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\\r\\nupon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance\\r\\nof the seamen.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\\r\\nrather not sleep with your own brother. I don\\u2019t know how it is, but\\r\\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\\r\\nsleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\\r\\ntown, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\\r\\nmultiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\\r\\nsleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\\r\\ntwo in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they\\r\\nall sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\\r\\ncover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\\r\\nthought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\\r\\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\\r\\nthe tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\\r\\nBesides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be\\r\\nhome and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\\r\\nmidnight\\u2014how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLandlord! I\\u2019ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.\\u2014I shan\\u2019t\\r\\nsleep with him. I\\u2019ll try the bench here.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cJust as you please; I\\u2019m sorry I can\\u2019t spare ye a tablecloth for a\\r\\nmattress, and it\\u2019s a plaguy rough board here\\u201d\\u2014feeling of the knots\\r\\nand notches. \\u201cBut wait a bit, Skrimshander; I\\u2019ve got a carpenter\\u2019s\\r\\nplane there in the bar\\u2014wait, I say, and I\\u2019ll make ye snug enough.\\u201d\\r\\nSo saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\\r\\nfirst dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the\\r\\nwhile grinning like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till\\r\\nat last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The\\r\\nlandlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven\\u2019s\\r\\nsake to quit\\u2014the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know\\r\\nhow all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank.\\r\\nSo gathering up the shavings with another grin, and throwing them into\\r\\nthe great stove in the middle of the room, he went about his business,\\r\\nand left me in a brown study.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\\r\\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\\r\\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\\r\\nthan the planed one\\u2014so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\\r\\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\\r\\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\\r\\nsoon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under\\r\\nthe sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially\\r\\nas another current from the rickety door met the one from the window,\\r\\nand both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate\\r\\nvicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn\\u2019t I steal\\r\\na march on him\\u2014bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\\r\\nwakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\\r\\nsecond thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\\r\\nmorning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\\r\\nstanding in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending\\r\\na sufferable night unless in some other person\\u2019s bed, I began to think\\r\\nthat after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against\\r\\nthis unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I\\u2019ll wait awhile; he must be\\r\\ndropping in before long. I\\u2019ll have a good look at him then, and\\r\\nperhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after all\\u2014there\\u2019s no\\r\\ntelling.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\\r\\nand going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLandlord!\\u201d said I, \\u201cwhat sort of a chap is he\\u2014does he always\\r\\nkeep such late hours?\\u201d It was now hard upon twelve o\\u2019clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\\r\\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. \\u201cNo,\\u201d he\\r\\nanswered, \\u201cgenerally he\\u2019s an early bird\\u2014airley to bed and airley\\r\\nto rise\\u2014yes, he\\u2019s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he\\r\\nwent out a peddling, you see, and I don\\u2019t see what on airth keeps him\\r\\nso late, unless, may be, he can\\u2019t sell his head.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCan\\u2019t sell his head?\\u2014What sort of a bamboozingly story is this\\r\\nyou are telling me?\\u201d getting into a towering rage. \\u201cDo you pretend\\r\\nto say, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\\r\\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\\r\\nthis town?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s precisely it,\\u201d said the landlord, \\u201cand I told him he\\r\\ncouldn\\u2019t sell it here, the market\\u2019s overstocked.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWith what?\\u201d shouted I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWith heads to be sure; ain\\u2019t there too many heads in the world?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI tell you what it is, landlord,\\u201d said I quite calmly, \\u201cyou\\u2019d\\r\\nbetter stop spinning that yarn to me\\u2014I\\u2019m not green.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMay be not,\\u201d taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \\u201cbut I\\r\\nrayther guess you\\u2019ll be done brown if that ere harpooneer hears you a\\r\\nslanderin\\u2019 his head.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI\\u2019ll break it for him,\\u201d said I, now flying into a passion again\\r\\nat this unaccountable farrago of the landlord\\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s broke a\\u2019ready,\\u201d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBroke,\\u201d said I\\u2014\\u201cbroke, do you mean?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSartain, and that\\u2019s the very reason he can\\u2019t sell it, I guess.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLandlord,\\u201d said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\\r\\nsnow-storm\\u2014\\u201clandlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\\r\\nanother, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\\r\\nbed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\\r\\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I\\r\\nhave not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\\r\\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\\r\\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellow\\u2014a sort of connexion,\\r\\nlandlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\\r\\ndegree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\\r\\nharpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\\r\\nnight with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\\r\\nthat story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\\r\\nevidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I\\u2019ve no idea of\\r\\nsleeping with a madman; and you, sir, you I mean, landlord, you, sir,\\r\\nby trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself\\r\\nliable to a criminal prosecution.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWall,\\u201d said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \\u201cthat\\u2019s a\\r\\npurty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be\\r\\neasy, be easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin\\u2019 you of has\\r\\njust arrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of \\u2018balmed\\r\\nNew Zealand heads (great curios, you know), and he\\u2019s sold all on\\r\\n\\u2018em but one, and that one he\\u2019s trying to sell to-night, cause\\r\\nto-morrow\\u2019s Sunday, and it would not do to be sellin\\u2019 human heads\\r\\nabout the streets when folks is goin\\u2019 to churches. He wanted to, last\\r\\nSunday, but I stopped him just as he was goin\\u2019 out of the door with\\r\\nfour heads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of\\r\\ninions.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\\r\\nthat the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me\\u2014but at\\r\\nthe same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\\r\\nSaturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\\r\\nbusiness as selling the heads of dead idolators?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDepend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe pays reg\\u2019lar,\\u201d was the rejoinder. \\u201cBut come, it\\u2019s getting\\r\\ndreadful late, you had better be turning flukes\\u2014it\\u2019s a nice bed; Sal\\r\\nand me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There\\u2019s plenty\\r\\nof room for two to kick about in that bed; it\\u2019s an almighty big bed\\r\\nthat. Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little\\r\\nJohnny in the foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one\\r\\nnight, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking\\r\\nhis arm. Arter that, Sal said it wouldn\\u2019t do. Come along here, I\\u2019ll\\r\\ngive ye a glim in a jiffy;\\u201d and so saying he lighted a candle and held\\r\\nit towards me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute;\\r\\nwhen looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed \\u201cI vum it\\u2019s\\r\\nSunday\\u2014you won\\u2019t see that harpooneer to-night; he\\u2019s come to anchor\\r\\nsomewhere\\u2014come along then; do come; won\\u2019t ye come?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\\r\\nushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\\r\\nwith a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers\\r\\nto sleep abreast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere,\\u201d said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\\r\\nchest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \\u201cthere,\\r\\nmake yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\\u201d I turned round\\r\\nfrom eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the\\r\\nmost elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced\\r\\nround the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see\\r\\nno other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four\\r\\nwalls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of\\r\\nthings not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed\\r\\nup, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman\\u2019s\\r\\nbag, containing the harpooneer\\u2019s wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land\\r\\ntrunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the\\r\\nshelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of\\r\\nthe bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\\r\\nlight, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive\\r\\nat some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to\\r\\nnothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\\r\\ntinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\\r\\nIndian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,\\r\\nas you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\\r\\nthat any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\\r\\nstreets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try\\r\\nit, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and\\r\\nthick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer\\r\\nhad been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass\\r\\nstuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore\\r\\nmyself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\\r\\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\\r\\nthe bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\\r\\nthe middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought\\r\\na little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\\r\\nhalf undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\\r\\nthe harpooneer\\u2019s not coming home at all that night, it being so very\\r\\nlate, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and\\r\\nthen blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the\\r\\ncare of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\\r\\nthere is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep\\r\\nfor a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty\\r\\nnearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy\\r\\nfootfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room\\r\\nfrom under the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\\r\\nhead-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\\r\\ntill spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\\r\\nZealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\\r\\nlooking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the\\r\\nfloor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords\\r\\nof the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all\\r\\neagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while\\r\\nemployed in unlacing the bag\\u2019s mouth. This accomplished, however, he\\r\\nturned round\\u2014when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of\\r\\na dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large\\r\\nblackish looking squares. Yes, it\\u2019s just as I thought, he\\u2019s a\\r\\nterrible bedfellow; he\\u2019s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here\\r\\nhe is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn\\r\\nhis face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\\r\\nsticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\\r\\nstains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\\r\\nbut soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story\\r\\nof a white man\\u2014a whaleman too\\u2014who, falling among the cannibals, had\\r\\nbeen tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course\\r\\nof his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And\\r\\nwhat is it, thought I, after all! It\\u2019s only his outside; a man can\\r\\nbe honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly\\r\\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely\\r\\nindependent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing\\r\\nbut a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun\\u2019s\\r\\ntanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never\\r\\nbeen in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\\r\\nextraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\\r\\npassing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me\\r\\nat all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\\r\\nfumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\\r\\nseal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the\\r\\nmiddle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head\\u2014a ghastly thing\\r\\nenough\\u2014and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his hat\\u2014a\\r\\nnew beaver hat\\u2014when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise. There\\r\\nwas no hair on his head\\u2014none to speak of at least\\u2014nothing but a\\r\\nsmall scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now\\r\\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\\r\\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\\r\\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\\r\\nit was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of\\r\\nthis head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\\r\\nIgnorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\\r\\nconfounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him\\r\\nas if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\\r\\nthe dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not\\r\\ngame enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\\r\\nconcerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\\r\\nhis chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered\\r\\nwith the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same\\r\\ndark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years\\u2019 War, and just\\r\\nescaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very\\r\\nlegs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up\\r\\nthe trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some\\r\\nabominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South\\r\\nSeas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it.\\r\\nA peddler of heads too\\u2014perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might\\r\\ntake a fancy to mine\\u2014heavens! look at that tomahawk!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\\r\\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that\\r\\nhe must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or\\r\\ndreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the\\r\\npockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a\\r\\nhunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days\\u2019 old Congo\\r\\nbaby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that\\r\\nthis black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But\\r\\nseeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal\\r\\nlike polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden\\r\\nidol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the\\r\\nempty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this\\r\\nlittle hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The\\r\\nchimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I\\r\\nthought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel\\r\\nfor his Congo idol.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\\r\\nill at ease meantime\\u2014to see what was next to follow. First he takes\\r\\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\\r\\nthem carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\\r\\ntop and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\\r\\na sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire,\\r\\nand still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be\\r\\nscorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;\\r\\nthen blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of\\r\\nit to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such\\r\\ndry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange\\r\\nantics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the\\r\\ndevotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some\\r\\npagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the\\r\\nmost unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol\\r\\nup very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\\r\\ncarelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\\r\\nseeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\\r\\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\\r\\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\\r\\nI had so long been bound.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\\r\\nTaking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an\\r\\ninstant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,\\r\\nhe puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light\\r\\nwas extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth,\\r\\nsprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving\\r\\na sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\\r\\n\\r\\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\\r\\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\\r\\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\\r\\nguttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho-e debel you?\\u201d\\u2014he at last said\\u2014\\u201cyou no speak-e, dam-me, I\\r\\nkill-e.\\u201d And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me\\r\\nin the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLandlord, for God\\u2019s sake, Peter Coffin!\\u201d shouted I. \\u201cLandlord!\\r\\nWatch! Coffin! Angels! save me!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSpeak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\\u201d again growled\\r\\nthe cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered\\r\\nthe hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\\r\\nfire. But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room\\r\\nlight in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t be afraid now,\\u201d said he, grinning again, \\u201cQueequeg here\\r\\nwouldn\\u2019t harm a hair of your head.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStop your grinning,\\u201d shouted I, \\u201cand why didn\\u2019t you tell me\\r\\nthat that infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI thought ye know\\u2019d it;\\u2014didn\\u2019t I tell ye, he was a peddlin\\u2019\\r\\nheads around town?\\u2014but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg,\\r\\nlook here\\u2014you sabbee me, I sabbee\\u2014you this man sleepe you\\u2014you\\r\\nsabbee?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMe sabbee plenty\\u201d\\u2014grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\\r\\nsitting up in bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou gettee in,\\u201d he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\\r\\nthrowing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil\\r\\nbut a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment.\\r\\nFor all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking\\r\\ncannibal. What\\u2019s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I\\r\\nto myself\\u2014the man\\u2019s a human being just as I am: he has just as much\\r\\nreason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a\\r\\nsober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLandlord,\\u201d said I, \\u201ctell him to stash his tomahawk there, or\\r\\npipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and\\r\\nI will turn in with him. But I don\\u2019t fancy having a man smoking in bed\\r\\nwith me. It\\u2019s dangerous. Besides, I ain\\u2019t insured.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\\r\\nmotioned me to get into bed\\u2014rolling over to one side as much as to\\r\\nsay\\u2014\\u201cI won\\u2019t touch a leg of ye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood night, landlord,\\u201d said I, \\u201cyou may go.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\\u2019s arm thrown\\r\\nover me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\\r\\nthought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\\r\\nodd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\\r\\ntattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no\\r\\ntwo parts of which were of one precise shade\\u2014owing I suppose to\\r\\nhis keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\\r\\nsleeves irregularly rolled up at various times\\u2014this same arm of his, I\\r\\nsay, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt.\\r\\nIndeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could\\r\\nhardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and\\r\\nit was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that\\r\\nQueequeg was hugging me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\\r\\nchild, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\\r\\nwhether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The\\r\\ncircumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other\\u2014I\\r\\nthink it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\\r\\nsweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\\r\\nwas all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,\\u2014my\\r\\nmother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\\r\\nbed, though it was only two o\\u2019clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\\r\\nthe longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\\r\\nthere was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\\r\\nthird floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\\r\\nand with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\\r\\nbefore I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the\\r\\nsmall of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the\\r\\nsun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\\r\\nstreets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\\r\\nand worse\\u2014at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\\r\\nstockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself\\r\\nat her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\\r\\nslippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie\\r\\nabed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most\\r\\nconscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\\r\\nseveral hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I\\r\\nhave ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At\\r\\nlast I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly\\r\\nwaking from it\\u2014half steeped in dreams\\u2014I opened my eyes, and the\\r\\nbefore sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I\\r\\nfelt a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and\\r\\nnothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.\\r\\nMy arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent\\r\\nform or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my\\r\\nbed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with\\r\\nthe most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking\\r\\nthat if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\\r\\nbroken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;\\r\\nbut waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for\\r\\ndays and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\\r\\nattempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle\\r\\nmyself with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\\r\\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\\r\\nthose which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\\u2019s pagan\\r\\narm thrown round me. But at length all the past night\\u2019s events soberly\\r\\nrecurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\\r\\nthe comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm\\u2014unlock his\\r\\nbridegroom clasp\\u2014yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\\r\\nas though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\\r\\nhim\\u2014\\u201cQueequeg!\\u201d\\u2014but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled\\r\\nover, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt\\r\\na slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\\r\\nsleeping by the savage\\u2019s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby.\\r\\nA pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\\r\\nbroad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \\u201cQueequeg!\\u2014in the name of\\r\\ngoodness, Queequeg, wake!\\u201d At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\\r\\nloud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\\r\\nhugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\\r\\nextracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\\r\\nall over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed,\\r\\nstiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he\\r\\ndid not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\\r\\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\\r\\nhim. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\\r\\nnow, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\\r\\nlast, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\\r\\nand he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\\r\\nthe floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\\r\\nif it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\\r\\nafterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\\r\\nunder the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\\r\\ntruth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what\\r\\nyou will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\\r\\nparticular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\\r\\ncivility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\\r\\nstaring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\\r\\nthe time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\\r\\na man like Queequeg you don\\u2019t see every day, he and his ways were well\\r\\nworth unusual regarding.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,\\r\\nby the by, and then\\u2014still minus his trowsers\\u2014he hunted up his\\r\\nboots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next\\r\\nmovement was to crush himself\\u2014boots in hand, and hat on\\u2014under the\\r\\nbed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he\\r\\nwas hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that\\r\\nI ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on\\r\\nhis boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\\r\\nstage\\u2014neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\\r\\nto show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\\r\\neducation was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\\r\\nbeen a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\\r\\nhimself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\\r\\nhe never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\\r\\nlast, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his\\r\\neyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\\r\\nbeing much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\\r\\nones\\u2014probably not made to order either\\u2014rather pinched and tormented\\r\\nhim at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\\r\\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\\r\\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\\r\\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;\\r\\nI begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat,\\r\\nand particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He\\r\\ncomplied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the\\r\\nmorning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to\\r\\nmy amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his\\r\\nchest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a\\r\\npiece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water\\r\\nand commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept\\r\\nhis razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed corner,\\r\\nslips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little\\r\\non his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall,\\r\\nbegins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks. Thinks\\r\\nI, Queequeg, this is using Rogers\\u2019s best cutlery with a vengeance.\\r\\nAfterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came to know of\\r\\nwhat fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp\\r\\nthe long straight edges are always kept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of\\r\\nthe room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his\\r\\nharpoon like a marshal\\u2019s baton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 5. Breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the\\r\\ngrinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,\\r\\nthough he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my\\r\\nbedfellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\\r\\ngood thing; the more\\u2019s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own\\r\\nproper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be\\r\\nbackward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in\\r\\nthat way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him,\\r\\nbe sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the\\r\\nnight previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were\\r\\nnearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates, and\\r\\nsea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and harpooneers,\\r\\nand ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky beards; an\\r\\nunshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This\\r\\nyoung fellow\\u2019s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and\\r\\nwould seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days\\r\\nlanded from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades\\r\\nlighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the\\r\\ncomplexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached\\r\\nwithal; he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show\\r\\na cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed like\\r\\nthe Andes\\u2019 western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting\\r\\nclimates, zone by zone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGrub, ho!\\u201d now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\\r\\nwent to breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease\\r\\nin manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard,\\r\\nthe great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all\\r\\nmen, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But perhaps the\\r\\nmere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as Ledyard did, or\\r\\nthe taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in the negro heart\\r\\nof Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo\\u2019s performances\\u2014this kind\\r\\nof travel, I say, may not be the very best mode of attaining a high\\r\\nsocial polish. Still, for the most part, that sort of thing is to be had\\r\\nanywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\\r\\nafter we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some\\r\\ngood stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every\\r\\nman maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked\\r\\nembarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the\\r\\nslightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas\\u2014entire\\r\\nstrangers to them\\u2014and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here\\r\\nthey sat at a social breakfast table\\u2014all of the same calling, all of\\r\\nkindred tastes\\u2014looking round as sheepishly at each other as though\\r\\nthey had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green\\r\\nMountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior\\r\\nwhalemen!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as for Queequeg\\u2014why, Queequeg sat there among them\\u2014at the head\\r\\nof the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I\\r\\ncannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have\\r\\ncordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,\\r\\nand using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,\\r\\nto the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks\\r\\ntowards him. But that was certainly very coolly done by him, and every\\r\\none knows that in most people\\u2019s estimation, to do anything coolly is\\r\\nto do it genteelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg\\u2019s peculiarities here; how he\\r\\neschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\\r\\nbeefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew\\r\\nlike the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was\\r\\nsitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on,\\r\\nwhen I sallied out for a stroll.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 6. The Street.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\\r\\nan individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\\r\\ncivilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\\r\\ndaylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\\r\\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign\\r\\nparts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners\\r\\nwill sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not\\r\\nunknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live\\r\\nYankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water\\r\\nStreet and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors;\\r\\nbut in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners;\\r\\nsavages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh. It\\r\\nmakes a stranger stare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,\\r\\nand Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft\\r\\nwhich unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still\\r\\nmore curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town\\r\\nscores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain\\r\\nand glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;\\r\\nfellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch\\r\\nthe whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence they\\r\\ncame. In some things you would think them but a few hours old. Look\\r\\nthere! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat and\\r\\nswallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife. Here\\r\\ncomes another with a sou\\u2019-wester and a bombazine cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one\\u2014I mean a\\r\\ndownright bumpkin dandy\\u2014a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\\r\\ntwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a\\r\\ncountry dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished\\r\\nreputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the\\r\\ncomical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his\\r\\nsea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his\\r\\ncanvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those straps\\r\\nin the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps, buttons, and\\r\\nall, down the throat of the tempest.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals, and\\r\\nbumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a queer\\r\\nplace. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would this\\r\\nday perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of Labrador.\\r\\nAs it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten one, they\\r\\nlook so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live\\r\\nin, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not like\\r\\nCanaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run with\\r\\nmilk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in\\r\\nspite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like\\r\\nhouses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came\\r\\nthey? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country?\\r\\n\\r\\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\\r\\nmansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses\\r\\nand flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans.\\r\\nOne and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom\\r\\nof the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\\r\\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\\r\\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,\\r\\nthey have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly\\r\\nburn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples\\u2014long\\r\\navenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful and\\r\\nbountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by their\\r\\ntapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is art;\\r\\nwhich in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright terraces\\r\\nof flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creation\\u2019s\\r\\nfinal day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But\\r\\nroses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks\\r\\nis perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that\\r\\nbloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young\\r\\ngirls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off\\r\\nshore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of\\r\\nthe Puritanic sands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 7. The Chapel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman\\u2019s Chapel, and few are\\r\\nthe moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who\\r\\nfail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this\\r\\nspecial errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving\\r\\nsleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called\\r\\nbearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found\\r\\na small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors\\u2019 wives and\\r\\nwidows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks\\r\\nof the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from\\r\\nthe other, as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable. The\\r\\nchaplain had not yet arrived; and there these silent islands of men and\\r\\nwomen sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets, with black borders,\\r\\nmasoned into the wall on either side the pulpit. Three of them ran\\r\\nsomething like the following, but I do not pretend to quote:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was\\r\\nlost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, November\\r\\n1st, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,\\r\\nWALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats\\u2019\\r\\ncrews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the\\r\\nOff-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, December 31st, 1839. THIS MARBLE Is\\r\\nhere placed by their surviving SHIPMATES.\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows\\r\\nof his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, August\\r\\n3d, 1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated myself\\r\\nnear the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see Queequeg near\\r\\nme. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a wondering gaze\\r\\nof incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage was the only\\r\\nperson present who seemed to notice my entrance; because he was the only\\r\\none who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading those frigid\\r\\ninscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of the seamen\\r\\nwhose names appeared there were now among the congregation, I knew not;\\r\\nbut so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery, and so plainly\\r\\ndid several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings\\r\\nof some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here before me were\\r\\nassembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak\\r\\ntablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing among\\r\\nflowers can say\\u2014here, here lies my beloved; ye know not the\\r\\ndesolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in\\r\\nthose black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in those\\r\\nimmovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in\\r\\nthe lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse resurrections to\\r\\nthe beings who have placelessly perished without a grave. As well might\\r\\nthose tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as here.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;\\r\\nwhy it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no\\r\\ntales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is\\r\\nthat to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix\\r\\nso significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if\\r\\nhe but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the\\r\\nLife Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what\\r\\neternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies\\r\\nantique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we\\r\\nstill refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are\\r\\ndwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all\\r\\nthe dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a\\r\\nwhole city. All these things are not without their meanings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these\\r\\ndead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\\r\\nNantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky\\r\\nlight of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen\\r\\nwho had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But\\r\\nsomehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine\\r\\nchance for promotion, it seems\\u2014aye, a stove boat will make me an\\r\\nimmortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling\\u2014a\\r\\nspeechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what\\r\\nthen? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.\\r\\nMethinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true\\r\\nsubstance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too\\r\\nmuch like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that\\r\\nthick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my\\r\\nbetter being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not\\r\\nme. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and\\r\\nstove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\\r\\nrobustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon\\r\\nadmitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,\\r\\nsufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it\\r\\nwas the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he\\r\\nwas a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his\\r\\nyouth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry.\\r\\nAt the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a\\r\\nhealthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second\\r\\nflowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone\\r\\ncertain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom\\u2014the spring verdure\\r\\npeeping forth even beneath February\\u2019s snow. No one having previously\\r\\nheard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without\\r\\nthe utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\\r\\npeculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\\r\\nhe had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and\\r\\ncertainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down\\r\\nwith melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to\\r\\ndrag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed.\\r\\nHowever, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up\\r\\nin a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit,\\r\\nhe quietly approached the pulpit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\\r\\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor,\\r\\nseriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect,\\r\\nit seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the\\r\\npulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like\\r\\nthose used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife of a whaling\\r\\ncaptain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted\\r\\nman-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely headed, and\\r\\nstained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance, considering what\\r\\nmanner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad taste. Halting for\\r\\nan instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both hands grasping the\\r\\nornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards,\\r\\nand then with a truly sailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand\\r\\nover hand, mounted the steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case with\\r\\nswinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of wood,\\r\\nso that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of the\\r\\npulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\\r\\nthese joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\\r\\nprepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn\\r\\nround, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder\\r\\nstep by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him\\r\\nimpregnable in his little Quebec.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\\r\\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity,\\r\\nthat I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks\\r\\nof the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this\\r\\nthing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be,\\r\\nthen, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual\\r\\nwithdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions?\\r\\nYes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful\\r\\nman of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold\\u2014a\\r\\nlofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\\r\\nborrowed from the chaplain\\u2019s former sea-farings. Between the marble\\r\\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back\\r\\nwas adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\\r\\nagainst a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\\r\\nbreakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\\r\\nfloated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel\\u2019s\\r\\nface; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\\r\\nship\\u2019s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\\r\\nthe Victory\\u2019s plank where Nelson fell. \\u201cAh, noble ship,\\u201d the angel\\r\\nseemed to say, \\u201cbeat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy\\r\\nhelm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling\\r\\noff\\u2014serenest azure is at hand.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\\r\\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in\\r\\nthe likeness of a ship\\u2019s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on\\r\\na projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship\\u2019s\\r\\nfiddle-headed beak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could be more full of meaning?\\u2014for the pulpit is ever this\\r\\nearth\\u2019s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit\\r\\nleads the world. From thence it is the storm of God\\u2019s quick wrath is\\r\\nfirst descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence\\r\\nit is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable\\r\\nwinds. Yes, the world\\u2019s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage\\r\\ncomplete; and the pulpit is its prow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 9. The Sermon.\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered\\r\\nthe scattered people to condense. \\u201cStarboard gangway, there! side away\\r\\nto larboard\\u2014larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\\r\\nstill slighter shuffling of women\\u2019s shoes, and all was quiet again,\\r\\nand every eye on the preacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\\u2019s bows, folded his\\r\\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\\r\\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at\\r\\nthe bottom of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of\\r\\na bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog\\u2014in such tones he\\r\\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\\r\\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n     \\u201cThe ribs and terrors in the whale,\\r\\n     Arched over me a dismal gloom,\\r\\n     While all God\\u2019s sun-lit waves rolled by,\\r\\n     And lift me deepening down to doom.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \\u201cI saw the opening maw of hell,\\r\\n     With endless pains and sorrows there;\\r\\n     Which none but they that feel can tell\\u2014\\r\\n     Oh, I was plunging to despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \\u201cIn black distress, I called my God,\\r\\n     When I could scarce believe him mine,\\r\\n     He bowed his ear to my complaints\\u2014\\r\\n     No more the whale did me confine.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \\u201cWith speed he flew to my relief,\\r\\n     As on a radiant dolphin borne;\\r\\n     Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone\\r\\n     The face of my Deliverer God.\\r\\n\\r\\n     \\u201cMy song for ever shall record\\r\\n     That terrible, that joyful hour;\\r\\n     I give the glory to my God,\\r\\n     His all the mercy and the power.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\\r\\nhowling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned\\r\\nover the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon\\r\\nthe proper page, said: \\u201cBeloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of\\r\\nthe first chapter of Jonah\\u2014\\u2018And God had prepared a great fish to\\r\\nswallow up Jonah.\\u2019\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShipmates, this book, containing only four chapters\\u2014four yarns\\u2014is\\r\\none of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.\\r\\nYet what depths of the soul does Jonah\\u2019s deep sealine sound! what\\r\\na pregnant lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that\\r\\ncanticle in the fish\\u2019s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand!\\r\\nWe feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy\\r\\nbottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us!\\r\\nBut what is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is\\r\\na two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson\\r\\nto me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to\\r\\nus all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly\\r\\nawakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally\\r\\nthe deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the sin\\r\\nof this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of\\r\\nGod\\u2014never mind now what that command was, or how conveyed\\u2014which he\\r\\nfound a hard command. But all the things that God would have us do are\\r\\nhard for us to do\\u2014remember that\\u2014and hence, he oftener commands\\r\\nus than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we must disobey\\r\\nourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness\\r\\nof obeying God consists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWith this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\\r\\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men will\\r\\ncarry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the Captains\\r\\nof this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship\\r\\nthat\\u2019s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded\\r\\nmeaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city\\r\\nthan the modern Cadiz. That\\u2019s the opinion of learned men. And where\\r\\nis Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa,\\r\\nas Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when the\\r\\nAtlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa,\\r\\nshipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean, the\\r\\nSyrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the\\r\\nwestward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye\\r\\nnot then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?\\r\\nMiserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with\\r\\nslouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the\\r\\nshipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So disordered,\\r\\nself-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen in those\\r\\ndays, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had been arrested\\r\\nere he touched a deck. How plainly he\\u2019s a fugitive! no baggage, not a\\r\\nhat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,\\u2014no friends accompany him to the wharf\\r\\nwith their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he finds the\\r\\nTarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps on\\r\\nboard to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the moment\\r\\ndesist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger\\u2019s evil eye.\\r\\nJonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence;\\r\\nin vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure\\r\\nthe mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious\\r\\nway, one whispers to the other\\u2014\\u201cJack, he\\u2019s robbed a widow;\\u201d or,\\r\\n\\u201cJoe, do you mark him; he\\u2019s a bigamist;\\u201d or, \\u201cHarry lad, I guess\\r\\nhe\\u2019s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one\\r\\nof the missing murderers from Sodom.\\u201d Another runs to read the bill\\r\\nthat\\u2019s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is\\r\\nmoored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a\\r\\nparricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and\\r\\nlooks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now\\r\\ncrowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah\\r\\ntrembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so\\r\\nmuch the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that\\r\\nitself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the\\r\\nsailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him\\r\\npass, and he descends into the cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Who\\u2019s there?\\u2019 cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly\\r\\nmaking out his papers for the Customs\\u2014\\u2018Who\\u2019s there?\\u2019 Oh! how\\r\\nthat harmless question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns\\r\\nto flee again. But he rallies. \\u2018I seek a passage in this ship to\\r\\nTarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?\\u2019 Thus far the busy Captain had not\\r\\nlooked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner\\r\\ndoes he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.\\r\\n\\u2018We sail with the next coming tide,\\u2019 at last he slowly answered,\\r\\nstill intently eyeing him. \\u2018No sooner, sir?\\u2019\\u2014\\u2018Soon enough for\\r\\nany honest man that goes a passenger.\\u2019 Ha! Jonah, that\\u2019s another\\r\\nstab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. \\u2018I\\u2019ll\\r\\nsail with ye,\\u2019\\u2014he says,\\u2014\\u2018the passage money how much is\\r\\nthat?\\u2014I\\u2019ll pay now.\\u2019 For it is particularly written, shipmates, as\\r\\nif it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, \\u2018that he paid\\r\\nthe fare thereof\\u2019 ere the craft did sail. And taken with the context,\\r\\nthis is full of meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow Jonah\\u2019s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\\r\\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In\\r\\nthis world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and\\r\\nwithout a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all\\r\\nfrontiers. So Jonah\\u2019s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah\\u2019s\\r\\npurse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum; and\\r\\nit\\u2019s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;\\r\\nbut at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with\\r\\ngold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions\\r\\nstill molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit. Not\\r\\na forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his\\r\\npassage. \\u2018Point out my state-room, Sir,\\u2019 says Jonah now, \\u2018I\\u2019m\\r\\ntravel-weary; I need sleep.\\u2019 \\u2018Thou lookest like it,\\u2019 says the\\r\\nCaptain, \\u2018there\\u2019s thy room.\\u2019 Jonah enters, and would lock the\\r\\ndoor, but the lock contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling\\r\\nthere, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about\\r\\nthe doors of convicts\\u2019 cells being never allowed to be locked within.\\r\\nAll dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and\\r\\nfinds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The\\r\\nair is close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,\\r\\nbeneath the ship\\u2019s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment\\r\\nof that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of\\r\\nhis bowels\\u2019 wards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cScrewed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\\r\\noscillates in Jonah\\u2019s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\\r\\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\\r\\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity with\\r\\nreference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight itself, it\\r\\nbut made obvious the false, lying levels among which it hung. The lamp\\r\\nalarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes\\r\\nroll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no\\r\\nrefuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more\\r\\nand more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry.\\r\\n\\u2018Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!\\u2019 he groans, \\u2018straight upwards,\\r\\nso it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\\r\\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the\\r\\nRoman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as\\r\\none who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish,\\r\\npraying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid\\r\\nthe whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the\\r\\nman who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there\\u2019s\\r\\nnaught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah\\u2019s\\r\\nprodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and\\r\\nfrom the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,\\r\\nglides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded\\r\\nsmugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not\\r\\nbear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to\\r\\nbreak. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her;\\r\\nwhen boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind\\r\\nis shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with\\r\\ntrampling feet right over Jonah\\u2019s head; in all this raging tumult,\\r\\nJonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,\\r\\nfeels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far\\r\\nrush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving the\\r\\nseas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides of\\r\\nthe ship\\u2014a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast asleep.\\r\\nBut the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead ear,\\r\\n\\u2018What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!\\u2019 Startled from his lethargy\\r\\nby that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the\\r\\ndeck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he\\r\\nis sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave after\\r\\nwave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs roaring\\r\\nfore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.\\r\\nAnd ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep\\r\\ngullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing\\r\\nbowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the\\r\\ntormented deep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTerrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his\\r\\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The\\r\\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\\r\\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter\\r\\nto high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this\\r\\ngreat tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah\\u2019s; that discovered,\\r\\nthen how furiously they mob him with their questions. \\u2018What is thine\\r\\noccupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,\\r\\nmy shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask him\\r\\nwho he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer to\\r\\nthose questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put by\\r\\nthem, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard hand\\r\\nof God that is upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018I am a Hebrew,\\u2019 he cries\\u2014and then\\u2014\\u2018I fear the Lord the God\\r\\nof Heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!\\u2019 Fear him, O Jonah?\\r\\nAye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God then! Straightway, he now goes\\r\\non to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more\\r\\nand more appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet\\r\\nsupplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of\\r\\nhis deserts,\\u2014when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and\\r\\ncast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for his sake this great\\r\\ntempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by\\r\\nother means to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls\\r\\nlouder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other\\r\\nthey not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\\r\\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\\r\\nis still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth\\r\\nwater behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless\\r\\ncommotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into\\r\\nthe yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory\\r\\nteeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed unto\\r\\nthe Lord out of the fish\\u2019s belly. But observe his prayer, and learn\\r\\na weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and wail for\\r\\ndirect deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is just. He\\r\\nleaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with this, that\\r\\nspite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards His holy\\r\\ntemple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance; not\\r\\nclamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing to\\r\\nGod was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance of\\r\\nhim from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah before\\r\\nyou to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a model\\r\\nfor repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it like\\r\\nJonah.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\\r\\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\\r\\nwhen describing Jonah\\u2019s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\\r\\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed the\\r\\nwarring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from off his\\r\\nswarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his simple\\r\\nhearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the leaves\\r\\nof the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with closed\\r\\neyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,\\r\\nwith an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these\\r\\nwords:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press\\r\\nupon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that\\r\\nJonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to me,\\r\\nfor I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come down\\r\\nfrom this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit, and\\r\\nlisten as you listen, while some one of you reads me that other and more\\r\\nawful lesson which Jonah teaches to me, as a pilot of the living God.\\r\\nHow being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true things, and\\r\\nbidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a\\r\\nwicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should raise, fled\\r\\nfrom his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God by taking\\r\\nship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we\\r\\nhave seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to\\r\\nliving gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along \\u2018into\\r\\nthe midst of the seas,\\u2019 where the eddying depths sucked him ten\\r\\nthousand fathoms down, and \\u2018the weeds were wrapped about his head,\\u2019\\r\\nand all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond\\r\\nthe reach of any plummet\\u2014\\u2018out of the belly of hell\\u2019\\u2014when the\\r\\nwhale grounded upon the ocean\\u2019s utmost bones, even then, God heard\\r\\nthe engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the\\r\\nfish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the\\r\\nwhale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all\\r\\nthe delights of air and earth; and \\u2018vomited out Jonah upon the dry\\r\\nland;\\u2019 when the word of the Lord came a second time; and\\r\\nJonah, bruised and beaten\\u2014his ears, like two sea-shells, still\\r\\nmultitudinously murmuring of the ocean\\u2014Jonah did the Almighty\\u2019s\\r\\nbidding. And what was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face\\r\\nof Falsehood! That was it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThis, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\\r\\nthe living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from\\r\\nGospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God\\r\\nhas brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than\\r\\nto appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe\\r\\nto him who, in this world, courts not dishonour! Woe to him who would\\r\\nnot be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him\\r\\nwho, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is\\r\\nhimself a castaway!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his\\r\\nface to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with\\r\\na heavenly enthusiasm,\\u2014\\u201cBut oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of\\r\\nevery woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,\\r\\nthan the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than\\r\\nthe kelson is low? Delight is to him\\u2014a far, far upward, and inward\\r\\ndelight\\u2014who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever\\r\\nstands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong\\r\\narms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has\\r\\ngone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the\\r\\ntruth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out\\r\\nfrom under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,\\u2014top-gallant\\r\\ndelight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his\\r\\nGod, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the\\r\\nwaves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake\\r\\nfrom this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness\\r\\nwill be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final\\r\\nbreath\\u2014O Father!\\u2014chiefly known to me by Thy rod\\u2014mortal or\\r\\nimmortal, here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this\\r\\nworld\\u2019s, or mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee;\\r\\nfor what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with\\r\\nhis hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,\\r\\nand he was left alone in the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\\r\\nquite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time.\\r\\nHe was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove\\r\\nhearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little\\r\\nnegro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife\\r\\ngently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his\\r\\nheathenish way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going\\r\\nto the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap\\r\\nbegan counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth\\r\\npage\\u2014as I fancied\\u2014stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him,\\r\\nand giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment.\\r\\nHe would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at\\r\\nnumber one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and\\r\\nit was only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that\\r\\nhis astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and\\r\\nhideously marred about the face\\u2014at least to my taste\\u2014his countenance\\r\\nyet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You cannot\\r\\nhide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I saw\\r\\nthe traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,\\r\\nfiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a\\r\\nthousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty bearing\\r\\nabout the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim.\\r\\nHe looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor.\\r\\nWhether it was, too, that his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn\\r\\nout in freer and brighter relief, and looked more expansive than it\\r\\notherwise would, this I will not venture to decide; but certain it was\\r\\nhis head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous,\\r\\nbut it reminded me of General Washington\\u2019s head, as seen in the\\r\\npopular busts of him. It had the same long regularly graded retreating\\r\\nslope from above the brows, which were likewise very projecting,\\r\\nlike two long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George\\r\\nWashington cannibalistically developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be\\r\\nlooking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my presence,\\r\\nnever troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but appeared\\r\\nwholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book.\\r\\nConsidering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night\\r\\nprevious, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found\\r\\nthrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference\\r\\nof his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do not\\r\\nknow exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their calm\\r\\nself-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had noticed\\r\\nalso that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the\\r\\nother seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have\\r\\nno desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck\\r\\nme as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something\\r\\nalmost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from\\r\\nhome, by the way of Cape Horn, that is\\u2014which was the only way he could\\r\\nget there\\u2014thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in\\r\\nthe planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving\\r\\nthe utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to\\r\\nhimself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he\\r\\nhad never heard there was such a thing as that. But, perhaps, to be\\r\\ntrue philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living or\\r\\nso striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives himself\\r\\nout for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic old woman, he\\r\\nmust have \\u201cbroken his digester.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that\\r\\nmild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then\\r\\nonly glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering\\r\\nround the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain;\\r\\nthe storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of\\r\\nstrange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart\\r\\nand maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing\\r\\nsavage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a\\r\\nnature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits.\\r\\nWild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to feel myself\\r\\nmysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that would have\\r\\nrepelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus drew me.\\r\\nI\\u2019ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness has\\r\\nproved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some\\r\\nfriendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At\\r\\nfirst he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my referring\\r\\nto his last night\\u2019s hospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we\\r\\nwere again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked\\r\\npleased, perhaps a little complimented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\\r\\nhim the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\\r\\nthat were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we went\\r\\nto jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen\\r\\nin this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and, producing\\r\\nhis pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And then we sat\\r\\nexchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it regularly\\r\\npassing between us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\\u2019s\\r\\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and left\\r\\nus cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as\\r\\nI to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his forehead against\\r\\nmine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were\\r\\nmarried; meaning, in his country\\u2019s phrase, that we were bosom friends;\\r\\nhe would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a countryman, this\\r\\nsudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature, a thing\\r\\nto be much distrusted; but in this simple savage those old rules would\\r\\nnot apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\\r\\ntogether. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\\r\\nenormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out\\r\\nsome thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\\r\\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them\\r\\ntowards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he\\r\\nsilenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\\u2019 pockets. I let them\\r\\nstay. He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and\\r\\nremoved the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he\\r\\nseemed anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow,\\r\\nI deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or\\r\\notherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\\r\\nPresbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in\\r\\nworshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do\\r\\nyou suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\\r\\nearth\\u2014pagans and all included\\u2014can possibly be jealous of an\\r\\ninsignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?\\u2014to\\r\\ndo the will of God\\u2014that is worship. And what is the will of God?\\u2014to\\r\\ndo to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me\\u2014that\\r\\nis the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish\\r\\nthat this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular\\r\\nPresbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him\\r\\nin his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped\\r\\nprop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with\\r\\nQueequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that\\r\\ndone, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences\\r\\nand all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential\\r\\ndisclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very\\r\\nbottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and\\r\\nchat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts\\u2019\\r\\nhoneymoon, lay I and Queequeg\\u2014a cosy, loving pair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 11. Nightgown.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\\r\\nQueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\\r\\nover mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\\r\\nand easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what\\r\\nlittle nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like\\r\\ngetting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\\r\\nbegan to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\\r\\nsitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\\r\\nhead-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\\r\\nnoses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt\\r\\nvery nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;\\r\\nindeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the\\r\\nroom. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some\\r\\nsmall part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world\\r\\nthat is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If\\r\\nyou flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so\\r\\na long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But if,\\r\\nlike Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown\\r\\nof your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general\\r\\nconsciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For this\\r\\nreason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which\\r\\nis one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this\\r\\nsort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and\\r\\nyour snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the\\r\\none warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at\\r\\nonce I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether\\r\\nby day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always\\r\\nkeeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness\\r\\nof being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright\\r\\nexcept his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element\\r\\nof our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon\\r\\nopening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created\\r\\ndarkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated\\r\\ntwelve-o\\u2019clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor\\r\\ndid I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best\\r\\nto strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he\\r\\nfelt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it\\r\\nsaid, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in\\r\\nthe bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow\\r\\nwhen love once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than\\r\\nto have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be\\r\\nfull of such serene household joy then. I no more felt unduly concerned\\r\\nfor the landlord\\u2019s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the\\r\\ncondensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket\\r\\nwith a real friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders,\\r\\nwe now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew\\r\\nover us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the\\r\\nnew-lit lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far\\r\\ndistant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and,\\r\\neager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly\\r\\ncomplied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his\\r\\nwords, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with\\r\\nhis broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as\\r\\nit may prove in the mere skeleton I give.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 12. Biographical.\\r\\n\\r\\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and\\r\\nSouth. It is not down in any map; true places never are.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in\\r\\na grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\\r\\nsapling; even then, in Queequeg\\u2019s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\\r\\ndesire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\\r\\ntwo. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;\\r\\nand on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\\r\\nunconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins\\u2014royal\\r\\nstuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he\\r\\nnourished in his untutored youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father\\u2019s bay, and Queequeg sought a\\r\\npassage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of\\r\\nseamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father\\u2019s influence\\r\\ncould prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled\\r\\noff to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\\r\\nshe quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low\\r\\ntongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the\\r\\nwater. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its\\r\\nprow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the\\r\\nship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with\\r\\none backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up\\r\\nthe chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled\\r\\na ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\\r\\ncutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\\r\\nQueequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild\\r\\ndesire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told him\\r\\nhe might make himself at home. But this fine young savage\\u2014this sea\\r\\nPrince of Wales, never saw the Captain\\u2019s cabin. They put him down\\r\\namong the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter\\r\\ncontent to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained\\r\\nno seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of\\r\\nenlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom\\u2014so he told\\r\\nme\\u2014he was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians,\\r\\nthe arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and\\r\\nmore than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of\\r\\nwhalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable\\r\\nand wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father\\u2019s heathens.\\r\\nArrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did\\r\\nthere; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their\\r\\nwages in that place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he,\\r\\nit\\u2019s a wicked world in all meridians; I\\u2019ll die a pagan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\\r\\nwore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\\r\\nways about him, though now some time from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\\r\\na coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\\r\\nbeing very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet;\\r\\nand added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had\\r\\nunfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan\\r\\nKings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,\\u2014as soon as\\r\\nhe felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to\\r\\nsail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a\\r\\nharpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\\r\\nmovements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\\r\\nthis, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\\r\\nintention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for\\r\\nan adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany\\r\\nme to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,\\r\\nthe same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap;\\r\\nwith both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds.\\r\\nTo all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt\\r\\nfor Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not\\r\\nfail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant\\r\\nof the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as\\r\\nknown to merchant seamen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis story being ended with his pipe\\u2019s last dying puff, Queequeg\\r\\nembraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the\\r\\nlight, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon\\r\\nwere sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,\\r\\nfor a block, I settled my own and comrade\\u2019s bill; using, however,\\r\\nmy comrade\\u2019s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders,\\r\\nseemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up\\r\\nbetween me and Queequeg\\u2014especially as Peter Coffin\\u2019s cock and bull\\r\\nstories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very\\r\\nperson whom I now companied with.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\\r\\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg\\u2019s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\\r\\ndown to \\u201cthe Moss,\\u201d the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at\\r\\nthe wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg\\r\\nso much\\u2014for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\\r\\nstreets,\\u2014but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\\r\\nheeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\\r\\nnow and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked\\r\\nhim why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\\r\\nwhether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\\r\\nsubstance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\\r\\nhe had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\\r\\nassured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\\r\\nwith the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and\\r\\nmowers, who go into the farmers\\u2019 meadows armed with their own\\r\\nscythes\\u2014though in no wise obliged to furnish them\\u2014even so, Queequeg,\\r\\nfor his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\\r\\nthe first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners\\r\\nof his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\\r\\nheavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\\r\\nthing\\u2014though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way\\r\\nin which to manage the barrow\\u2014Queequeg puts his chest upon it;\\r\\nlashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf.\\r\\n\\u201cWhy,\\u201d said I, \\u201cQueequeg, you might have known better than that,\\r\\none would think. Didn\\u2019t the people laugh?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\\r\\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\\r\\nof young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\\r\\nthis punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\\r\\nmat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\\r\\ntouched at Rokovoko, and its commander\\u2014from all accounts, a very\\r\\nstately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain\\u2014this\\r\\ncommander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg\\u2019s sister, a\\r\\npretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\\r\\nguests were assembled at the bride\\u2019s bamboo cottage, this Captain\\r\\nmarches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over\\r\\nagainst the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\\r\\nKing, Queequeg\\u2019s father. Grace being said,\\u2014for those people have\\r\\ntheir grace as well as we\\u2014though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who\\r\\nat such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary,\\r\\ncopying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all\\r\\nfeasts\\u2014Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by\\r\\nthe immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated\\r\\nand consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage\\r\\ncirculates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the\\r\\nceremony, and thinking himself\\u2014being Captain of a ship\\u2014as having\\r\\nplain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King\\u2019s\\r\\nown house\\u2014the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the\\r\\npunchbowl;\\u2014taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. \\u201cNow,\\u201d\\r\\nsaid Queequeg, \\u201cwhat you tink now?\\u2014Didn\\u2019t our people laugh?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.\\r\\nHoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one side, New\\r\\nBedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees all\\r\\nglittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of casks on\\r\\ncasks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the world-wandering\\r\\nwhale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while from others\\r\\ncame a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises of fires and\\r\\nforges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises were on the\\r\\nstart; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only begins a\\r\\nsecond; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on, for ever\\r\\nand for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness of all\\r\\nearthly effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little\\r\\nMoss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\\r\\nsnortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!\\u2014how I spurned that turnpike\\r\\nearth!\\u2014that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish\\r\\nheels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea\\r\\nwhich will permit no records.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\\r\\nHis dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed teeth.\\r\\nOn, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the\\r\\nblast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan. Sideways\\r\\nleaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a wire; the\\r\\ntwo tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes. So full of\\r\\nthis reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that\\r\\nfor some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a\\r\\nlubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so\\r\\ncompanionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a\\r\\nwhitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,\\r\\nby their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of\\r\\nall verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking\\r\\nhim behind his back. I thought the bumpkin\\u2019s hour of doom was come.\\r\\nDropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by\\r\\nan almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily\\r\\ninto the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the\\r\\nfellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning\\r\\nhis back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a\\r\\npuff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCapting! Capting!\\u201d yelled the bumpkin, running towards that\\r\\nofficer; \\u201cCapting, Capting, here\\u2019s the devil.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHallo, you sir,\\u201d cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea,\\r\\nstalking up to Queequeg, \\u201cwhat in thunder do you mean by that? Don\\u2019t\\r\\nyou know you might have killed that chap?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat him say?\\u201d said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe say,\\u201d said I, \\u201cthat you came near kill-e that man there,\\u201d\\r\\npointing to the still shivering greenhorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cKill-e,\\u201d cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an\\r\\nunearthly expression of disdain, \\u201cah! him bevy small-e fish-e;\\r\\nQueequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook you,\\u201d roared the Captain, \\u201cI\\u2019ll kill-e you, you cannibal,\\r\\nif you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\\r\\nmind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\\r\\nthe weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\\r\\nside, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\\r\\nfellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\\r\\nhands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\\r\\nseemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost\\r\\nin one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\\r\\nsnapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of\\r\\nbeing done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the\\r\\nboom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\\r\\nmidst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\\r\\ncrawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one\\r\\nend to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it\\r\\nround the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar\\r\\nwas that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the\\r\\nwind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg,\\r\\nstripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of\\r\\na leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,\\r\\nthrowing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing\\r\\nhis brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand\\r\\nand glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone\\r\\ndown. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now\\r\\ntook an instant\\u2019s glance around him, and seeming to see just how\\r\\nmatters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he\\r\\nrose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging\\r\\na lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was\\r\\nrestored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his\\r\\npardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till\\r\\npoor Queequeg took his last long dive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at\\r\\nall deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only\\r\\nasked for water\\u2014fresh water\\u2014something to wipe the brine off; that\\r\\ndone, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the\\r\\nbulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to\\r\\nhimself\\u2014\\u201cIt\\u2019s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\\r\\ncannibals must help these Christians.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 14. Nantucket.\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a\\r\\nfine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\\r\\n\\r\\nNantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of\\r\\nthe world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely\\r\\nthan the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it\\u2014a mere hillock, and elbow of\\r\\nsand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than\\r\\nyou would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some\\r\\ngamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they\\r\\ndon\\u2019t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they\\r\\nhave to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask;\\r\\nthat pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true\\r\\ncross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,\\r\\nto get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes\\r\\nan oasis, three blades in a day\\u2019s walk a prairie; that they wear\\r\\nquicksand shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so\\r\\nshut up, belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter\\r\\nisland of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams\\r\\nwill sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But\\r\\nthese extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\\r\\nsettled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle\\r\\nswooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\\r\\nIndian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne\\r\\nout of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same\\r\\ndirection. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they\\r\\ndiscovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,\\u2014the\\r\\npoor little Indian\\u2019s skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take\\r\\nto the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in\\r\\nthe sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\\r\\nexperienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\\r\\nlaunching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\\r\\nput an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at\\r\\nBehring\\u2019s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\\r\\neverlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\\r\\nflood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\\r\\nMastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\\r\\nhis very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\\r\\nmalicious assaults!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from\\r\\ntheir ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like\\r\\nso many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and\\r\\nIndian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add\\r\\nMexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm\\r\\nall India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of\\r\\nthis terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer\\u2019s. For the sea is his; he\\r\\nowns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of\\r\\nway through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but\\r\\nfloating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea\\r\\nas highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of\\r\\nthe land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the\\r\\nbottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on\\r\\nthe sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and\\r\\nfro ploughing it as his own special plantation. There is his home; there\\r\\nlies his business, which a Noah\\u2019s flood would not interrupt, though it\\r\\noverwhelmed all the millions in China. He lives on the sea, as prairie\\r\\ncocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs them as\\r\\nchamois hunters climb the Alps. For years he knows not the land; so\\r\\nthat when he comes to it at last, it smells like another world, more\\r\\nstrangely than the moon would to an Earthsman. With the landless gull,\\r\\nthat at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows;\\r\\nso at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of land, furls his sails,\\r\\nand lays him to his rest, while under his very pillow rush herds of\\r\\nwalruses and whales.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 15. Chowder.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly\\r\\nto anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\\r\\nbusiness that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord of\\r\\nthe Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\\r\\nTry Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\\r\\nhotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\\r\\nHosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\\r\\nplainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at\\r\\nthe Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow\\r\\nwarehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the\\r\\nlarboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\\r\\ncorner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\\r\\nman we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\\r\\nmuch puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\\r\\ninsisted that the yellow warehouse\\u2014our first point of departure\\u2014must\\r\\nbe left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to\\r\\nsay it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little\\r\\nin the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant\\r\\nto inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\\r\\nmistaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses\\u2019 ears,\\r\\nswung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\\r\\nold doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\\r\\nside, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\\r\\nPerhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\\r\\ncould not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of\\r\\ncrick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, two\\r\\nof them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It\\u2019s ominous, thinks I. A\\r\\nCoffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones\\r\\nstaring at me in the whalemen\\u2019s chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair\\r\\nof prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints\\r\\ntouching Tophet?\\r\\n\\r\\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\\r\\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\\r\\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\\r\\neye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\\r\\nshirt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGet along with ye,\\u201d said she to the man, \\u201cor I\\u2019ll be combing\\r\\nye!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome on, Queequeg,\\u201d said I, \\u201call right. There\\u2019s Mrs. Hussey.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\\r\\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\\r\\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing\\r\\nfurther scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and\\r\\nseating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded\\r\\nrepast, turned round to us and said\\u2014\\u201cClam or Cod?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that about Cods, ma\\u2019am?\\u201d said I, with much politeness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cClam or Cod?\\u201d she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA clam for supper? a cold clam; is that what you mean, Mrs.\\r\\nHussey?\\u201d says I, \\u201cbut that\\u2019s a rather cold and clammy reception in\\r\\nthe winter time, ain\\u2019t it, Mrs. Hussey?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\\r\\nShirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing\\r\\nbut the word \\u201cclam,\\u201d Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door\\r\\nleading to the kitchen, and bawling out \\u201cclam for two,\\u201d disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQueequeg,\\u201d said I, \\u201cdo you think that we can make out a supper\\r\\nfor us both on one clam?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\\r\\napparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\\r\\ncame in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\\r\\nhearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\\r\\nhazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into\\r\\nlittle flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned\\r\\nwith pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty\\r\\nvoyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food\\r\\nbefore him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched\\r\\nit with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking me\\r\\nof Mrs. Hussey\\u2019s clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try\\r\\na little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word\\r\\n\\u201ccod\\u201d with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the\\r\\nsavoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good\\r\\ntime a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks\\r\\nI to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?\\r\\nWhat\\u2019s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? \\u201cBut\\r\\nlook, Queequeg, ain\\u2019t that a live eel in your bowl? Where\\u2019s your\\r\\nharpoon?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved\\r\\nits name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\\r\\nbreakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\\r\\nbegan to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\\r\\nbefore the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished\\r\\nnecklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books\\r\\nbound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk,\\r\\ntoo, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening\\r\\nto take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen\\u2019s boats, I saw\\r\\nHosea\\u2019s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along\\r\\nthe sand with each foot in a cod\\u2019s decapitated head, looking very\\r\\nslip-shod, I assure ye.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\\r\\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede\\r\\nme up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his\\r\\nharpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. \\u201cWhy not?\\u201d said\\r\\nI; \\u201cevery true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon\\u2014but why not?\\u201d\\r\\n\\u201cBecause it\\u2019s dangerous,\\u201d says she. \\u201cEver since young Stiggs\\r\\ncoming from that unfort\\u2019nt v\\u2019y\\u2019ge of his, when he was gone four\\r\\nyears and a half, with only three barrels of ile, was found dead in my\\r\\nfirst floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow\\r\\nno boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So,\\r\\nMr. Queequeg\\u201d (for she had learned his name), \\u201cI will just take this\\r\\nhere iron, and keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or\\r\\ncod to-morrow for breakfast, men?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBoth,\\u201d says I; \\u201cand let\\u2019s have a couple of smoked herring by\\r\\nway of variety.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 16. The Ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and\\r\\nno small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\\r\\ndiligently consulting Yojo\\u2014the name of his black little god\\u2014and\\r\\nYojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\\r\\neveryway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\\r\\nharbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo\\r\\nearnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly\\r\\nwith me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to\\r\\ndo so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I,\\r\\nIshmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it\\r\\nhad turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\\r\\nmyself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed\\r\\ngreat confidence in the excellence of Yojo\\u2019s judgment and surprising\\r\\nforecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a\\r\\nrather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole,\\r\\nbut in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this plan of Queequeg\\u2019s, or rather Yojo\\u2019s, touching the\\r\\nselection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a\\r\\nlittle relied upon Queequeg\\u2019s sagacity to point out the whaler\\r\\nbest fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my\\r\\nremonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\\r\\nacquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a\\r\\ndetermined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle\\r\\nthat trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut\\r\\nup with Yojo in our little bedroom\\u2014for it seemed that it was some\\r\\nsort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer\\r\\nwith Queequeg and Yojo that day; how it was I never could find out, for,\\r\\nthough I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his\\r\\nliturgies and XXXIX Articles\\u2014leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his\\r\\ntomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of\\r\\nshavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged\\r\\nsauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three\\r\\nships up for three-years\\u2019 voyages\\u2014The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and\\r\\nthe Pequod. Devil-Dam, I do not know the origin of; Tit-bit is obvious;\\r\\nPequod, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated tribe\\r\\nof Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I peered\\r\\nand pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and\\r\\nfinally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and\\r\\nthen decided that this was the very ship for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\\r\\nknow;\\u2014square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\\r\\ngalliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\\r\\nrare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\\r\\nschool, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look\\r\\nabout her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms\\r\\nof all four oceans, her old hull\\u2019s complexion was darkened like a\\r\\nFrench grenadier\\u2019s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her\\r\\nvenerable bows looked bearded. Her masts\\u2014cut somewhere on the coast of\\r\\nJapan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale\\u2014her masts\\r\\nstood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne.\\r\\nHer ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\\r\\nflag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\\r\\nher old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\\r\\nto the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.\\r\\nOld Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded\\r\\nanother vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the\\r\\nprincipal owners of the Pequod,\\u2014this old Peleg, during the term of his\\r\\nchief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\\r\\nit, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched\\r\\nby anything except it be Thorkill-Hake\\u2019s carved buckler or bedstead.\\r\\nShe was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy\\r\\nwith pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal\\r\\nof a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies.\\r\\nAll round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one\\r\\ncontinuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted\\r\\nthere for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those\\r\\nthews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled\\r\\nover sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend\\r\\nhelm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass,\\r\\ncuriously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.\\r\\nThe helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the\\r\\nTartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble\\r\\ncraft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things are touched with\\r\\nthat.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,\\r\\nin order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw\\r\\nnobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or\\r\\nrather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only\\r\\na temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten\\r\\nfeet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken\\r\\nfrom the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale.\\r\\nPlanted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced\\r\\ntogether, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in\\r\\na tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the\\r\\ntop-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem\\u2019s head. A triangular opening\\r\\nfaced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a\\r\\ncomplete view forward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\\r\\nby his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the\\r\\nship\\u2019s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\\r\\ncommand. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\\r\\nover with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\\r\\nstout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\\r\\nconstructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\\r\\nthe elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\\r\\nand heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\\r\\nonly there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\\r\\nwrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from\\r\\nhis continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\\r\\nwindward;\\u2014for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\\r\\ntogether. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs this the Captain of the Pequod?\\u201d said I, advancing to the door\\r\\nof the tent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSupposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of\\r\\nhim?\\u201d he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI was thinking of shipping.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer\\u2014ever been in a\\r\\nstove boat?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, Sir, I never have.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say\\u2014eh?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I\\u2019ve been\\r\\nseveral voyages in the merchant service, and I think that\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMerchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that\\r\\nleg?\\u2014I\\u2019ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of\\r\\nthe marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose now\\r\\nye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships.\\r\\nBut flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?\\u2014it looks\\r\\na little suspicious, don\\u2019t it, eh?\\u2014Hast not been a pirate, hast\\r\\nthou?\\u2014Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?\\u2014Dost not think of\\r\\nmurdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask\\r\\nof these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated\\r\\nQuakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather\\r\\ndistrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the\\r\\nVineyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of\\r\\nshipping ye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWant to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain\\r\\nAhab?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho is Captain Ahab, sir?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain\\r\\nhimself.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThou art speaking to Captain Peleg\\u2014that\\u2019s who ye are speaking to,\\r\\nyoung man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted\\r\\nout for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We\\r\\nare part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest\\r\\nto know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of\\r\\nfinding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap\\r\\neye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one\\r\\nleg.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,\\r\\nchewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a\\r\\nboat!\\u2014ah, ah!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at\\r\\nthe hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as\\r\\nI could, \\u201cWhat you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I\\r\\nknow there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though\\r\\nindeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the\\r\\naccident.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d\\u2019ye see;\\r\\nthou dost not talk shark a bit. Sure, ye\\u2019ve been to sea before now;\\r\\nsure of that?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSir,\\u201d said I, \\u201cI thought I told you that I had been four voyages\\r\\nin the merchant\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant\\r\\nservice\\u2014don\\u2019t aggravate me\\u2014I won\\u2019t have it. But let us\\r\\nunderstand each other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is;\\r\\ndo ye yet feel inclined for it?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI do, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\\r\\nbe got rid of, that is; which I don\\u2019t take to be the fact.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find\\r\\nout by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to\\r\\nsee the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just\\r\\nstep forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back\\r\\nto me and tell me what ye see there.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\\r\\nknowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.\\r\\nBut concentrating all his crow\\u2019s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg\\r\\nstarted me on the errand.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\\r\\nship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\\r\\npointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but\\r\\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\\r\\ncould see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, what\\u2019s the report?\\u201d said Peleg when I came back; \\u201cwhat\\r\\ndid ye see?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNot much,\\u201d I replied\\u2014\\u201cnothing but water; considerable horizon\\r\\nthough, and there\\u2019s a squall coming up, I think.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to\\r\\ngo round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can\\u2019t ye see the world\\r\\nwhere you stand?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\\r\\nPequod was as good a ship as any\\u2014I thought the best\\u2014and all this\\r\\nI now repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his\\r\\nwillingness to ship me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\\u201d he\\r\\nadded\\u2014\\u201ccome along with ye.\\u201d And so saying, he led the way below\\r\\ndeck into the cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\\r\\nsurprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\\r\\nCaptain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\\r\\nshares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\\r\\nof old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each\\r\\nowning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail\\r\\nor two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling\\r\\nvessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks\\r\\nbringing in good interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\\r\\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\\r\\nthis day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\\r\\npeculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified\\r\\nby things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\\r\\nQuakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\\r\\nare fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\\r\\nnames\\u2014a singularly common fashion on the island\\u2014and in childhood\\r\\nnaturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker\\r\\nidiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure\\r\\nof their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown\\r\\npeculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a\\r\\nScandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things\\r\\nunite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain\\r\\nand a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion\\r\\nof many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath\\r\\nconstellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\\r\\nuntraditionally and independently; receiving all nature\\u2019s sweet or\\r\\nsavage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\\r\\nbreast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\\r\\nadvantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language\\u2014that man makes\\r\\none in a whole nation\\u2019s census\\u2014a mighty pageant creature, formed\\r\\nfor noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\\r\\nregarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\\r\\na half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all\\r\\nmen tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure\\r\\nof this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But,\\r\\nas yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and\\r\\nstill a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another\\r\\nphase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\\r\\nBut unlike Captain Peleg\\u2014who cared not a rush for what are called\\r\\nserious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\\r\\nveriest of all trifles\\u2014Captain Bildad had not only been originally\\r\\neducated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all\\r\\nhis subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island\\r\\ncreatures, round the Horn\\u2014all that had not moved this native born\\r\\nQuaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\\r\\nvest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of\\r\\ncommon consistency about worthy Captain Peleg. Though refusing, from\\r\\nconscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\\r\\nhad illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe\\r\\nto human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns\\r\\nupon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his\\r\\ndays, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\\r\\nnot know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably he\\r\\nhad long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man\\u2019s\\r\\nreligion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This\\r\\nworld pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes\\r\\nof the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat;\\r\\nfrom that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a\\r\\nship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous\\r\\ncareer by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of\\r\\nsixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his\\r\\nwell-earned income.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\\r\\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\\r\\ntask-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\\r\\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\\r\\nupon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore\\r\\nexhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was\\r\\ncertainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,\\r\\nthough, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate\\r\\nquantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a\\r\\nchief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made\\r\\nyou feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something\\u2014a hammer\\r\\nor a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other,\\r\\nnever mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own\\r\\nperson was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his\\r\\nlong, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard,\\r\\nhis chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his\\r\\nbroad-brimmed hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\\r\\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\\r\\nwas small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\\r\\nand never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\\r\\nplaced beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\\r\\nbuttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\\r\\nreading from a ponderous volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBildad,\\u201d cried Captain Peleg, \\u201cat it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have\\r\\nbeen studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\\r\\ncertain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\\r\\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and\\r\\nseeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe says he\\u2019s our man, Bildad,\\u201d said Peleg, \\u201che wants to\\r\\nship.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDost thee?\\u201d said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI dost,\\u201d said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat do ye think of him, Bildad?\\u201d said Peleg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019ll do,\\u201d said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away\\r\\nat his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\\r\\nhis friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\\r\\nnothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\\r\\nand drawing forth the ship\\u2019s articles, placed pen and ink before him,\\r\\nand seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\\r\\nto settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the\\r\\nvoyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no\\r\\nwages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of\\r\\nthe profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the\\r\\ndegree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship\\u2019s\\r\\ncompany. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own\\r\\nlay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea,\\r\\ncould steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that\\r\\nfrom all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay\\u2014that\\r\\nis, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever\\r\\nthat might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they\\r\\ncall a rather long lay, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a\\r\\nlucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out\\r\\non it, not to speak of my three years\\u2019 beef and board, for which I\\r\\nwould not have to pay one stiver.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\\r\\nfortune\\u2014and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\\r\\nthat never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\\r\\nworld is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim\\r\\nsign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay\\r\\nwould be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I\\r\\nbeen offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\\r\\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\\r\\nsomething of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\\r\\nhow that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\\r\\nthe other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\\r\\nwhole management of the ship\\u2019s affairs to these two. And I did not\\r\\nknow but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say\\r\\nabout shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\\r\\nquite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\\r\\nown fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\\r\\njack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was\\r\\nsuch an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\\r\\nus, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, \\u201cLay not up for\\r\\nyourselves treasures upon earth, where moth\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, Captain Bildad,\\u201d interrupted Peleg, \\u201cwhat d\\u2019ye say, what\\r\\nlay shall we give this young man?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThou knowest best,\\u201d was the sepulchral reply, \\u201cthe seven hundred\\r\\nand seventy-seventh wouldn\\u2019t be too much, would it?\\u2014\\u2018where moth\\r\\nand rust do corrupt, but lay\\u2014\\u2018\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLay, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\\r\\nshall not lay up many lays here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.\\r\\nIt was an exceedingly long lay that, indeed; and though from the\\r\\nmagnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\\r\\nthe slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make\\r\\na teenth of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\\r\\nhundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, blast your eyes, Bildad,\\u201d cried Peleg, \\u201cthou dost not want\\r\\nto swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSeven hundred and seventy-seventh,\\u201d again said Bildad, without\\r\\nlifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling\\u2014\\u201cfor where your treasure\\r\\nis, there will your heart be also.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\\u201d said Peleg,\\r\\n\\u201cdo ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\\r\\nduty thou owest to the other owners of this ship\\u2014widows and orphans,\\r\\nmany of them\\u2014and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of\\r\\nthis young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\\r\\norphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThou Bildad!\\u201d roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\\r\\ncabin. \\u201cBlast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\\r\\nthese matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\\r\\nwould be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round\\r\\nCape Horn.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Peleg,\\u201d said Bildad steadily, \\u201cthy conscience may be\\r\\ndrawing ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can\\u2019t tell; but as\\r\\nthou art still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\\r\\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering\\r\\ndown to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\\r\\ninsult me. It\\u2019s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\\r\\nhe\\u2019s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,\\r\\nand start my soul-bolts, but I\\u2019ll\\u2014I\\u2019ll\\u2014yes, I\\u2019ll swallow a\\r\\nlive goat with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,\\r\\ndrab-coloured son of a wooden gun\\u2014a straight wake with ye!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous\\r\\noblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\\r\\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\\r\\nall idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\\r\\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\\r\\nI made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\\r\\nwrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\\r\\ntransom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\\r\\nwithdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\\r\\nfor Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\\r\\nleft in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched\\r\\na little as if still nervously agitated. \\u201cWhew!\\u201d he whistled at\\r\\nlast\\u2014\\u201cthe squall\\u2019s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used\\r\\nto be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife\\r\\nhere needs the grindstone. That\\u2019s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my\\r\\nyoung man, Ishmael\\u2019s thy name, didn\\u2019t ye say? Well then, down ye go\\r\\nhere, Ishmael, for the three hundredth lay.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Peleg,\\u201d said I, \\u201cI have a friend with me who wants to\\r\\nship too\\u2014shall I bring him down to-morrow?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTo be sure,\\u201d said Peleg. \\u201cFetch him along, and we\\u2019ll look at\\r\\nhim.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat lay does he want?\\u201d groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\\r\\nin which he had again been burying himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\\u201d said Peleg. \\u201cHas he ever\\r\\nwhaled it any?\\u201d turning to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cKilled more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, bring him along then.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\\r\\nhad done a good morning\\u2019s work, and that the Pequod was the identical\\r\\nship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain\\r\\nwith whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in\\r\\nmany cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all\\r\\nher crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving\\r\\nto take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the\\r\\nshore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have\\r\\na family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble\\r\\nhimself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till\\r\\nall is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at\\r\\nhim before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back\\r\\nI accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It\\u2019s all right enough;\\r\\nthou art shipped.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, but I should like to see him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut I don\\u2019t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don\\u2019t know\\r\\nexactly what\\u2019s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\\r\\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he don\\u2019t look so. In fact, he ain\\u2019t\\r\\nsick; but no, he isn\\u2019t well either. Any how, young man, he won\\u2019t\\r\\nalways see me, so I don\\u2019t suppose he will thee. He\\u2019s a queer man,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab\\u2014so some think\\u2014but a good one. Oh, thou\\u2019lt like him\\r\\nwell enough; no fear, no fear. He\\u2019s a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab; doesn\\u2019t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\\r\\nmay well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\\u2019s above the common;\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s been in colleges, as well as \\u2018mong the cannibals; been used\\r\\nto deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\\r\\nstranger foes than whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\\r\\nthat out of all our isle! Oh! he ain\\u2019t Captain Bildad; no, and he\\r\\nain\\u2019t Captain Peleg; he\\u2019s Ahab, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\\r\\nwas a crowned king!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\\r\\nthey not lick his blood?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome hither to me\\u2014hither, hither,\\u201d said Peleg, with a\\r\\nsignificance in his eye that almost startled me. \\u201cLook ye, lad; never\\r\\nsay that on board the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did\\r\\nnot name himself. \\u2018Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\\r\\nmother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the\\r\\nold squaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\\r\\nprophetic. And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I\\r\\nwish to warn thee. It\\u2019s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I\\u2019ve sailed\\r\\nwith him as mate years ago; I know what he is\\u2014a good man\\u2014not a\\r\\npious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good man\\u2014something like\\r\\nme\\u2014only there\\u2019s a good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he\\r\\nwas never very jolly; and I know that on the passage home, he was a\\r\\nlittle out of his mind for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains\\r\\nin his bleeding stump that brought that about, as any one might see. I\\r\\nknow, too, that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed\\r\\nwhale, he\\u2019s been a kind of moody\\u2014desperate moody, and savage\\r\\nsometimes; but that will all pass off. And once for all, let me tell\\r\\nthee and assure thee, young man, it\\u2019s better to sail with a moody good\\r\\ncaptain than a laughing bad one. So good-bye to thee\\u2014and wrong not\\r\\nCaptain Ahab, because he happens to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy,\\r\\nhe has a wife\\u2014not three voyages wedded\\u2014a sweet, resigned girl. Think\\r\\nof that; by that sweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then\\r\\nthere can be any utter, hopeless harm in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken,\\r\\nblasted, if he be, Ahab has his humanities!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\\r\\nincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\\r\\nwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,\\r\\nI felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don\\u2019t know what,\\r\\nunless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange\\r\\nawe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was\\r\\nnot exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did\\r\\nnot disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed\\r\\nlike mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then. However,\\r\\nmy thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so that for the\\r\\npresent dark Ahab slipped my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Queequeg\\u2019s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue\\r\\nall day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for\\r\\nI cherish the greatest respect towards everybody\\u2019s religious\\r\\nobligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart\\r\\nto undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or\\r\\nthose other creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree\\r\\nof footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before\\r\\nthe torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the\\r\\ninordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\\r\\nthings, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\\r\\npagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\\r\\nsubjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\\r\\nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;\\u2014but what of that? Queequeg\\r\\nthought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;\\r\\nand there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let\\r\\nhim be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all\\u2014Presbyterians and\\r\\nPagans alike\\u2014for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head,\\r\\nand sadly need mending.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\\r\\nrituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;\\r\\nbut no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\\r\\n\\u201cQueequeg,\\u201d said I softly through the key-hole:\\u2014all silent. \\u201cI\\r\\nsay, Queequeg! why don\\u2019t you speak? It\\u2019s I\\u2014Ishmael.\\u201d But all\\r\\nremained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him\\r\\nsuch abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I\\r\\nlooked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of\\r\\nthe room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I\\r\\ncould only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall,\\r\\nbut nothing more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall\\r\\nthe wooden shaft of Queequeg\\u2019s harpoon, which the landlady the\\r\\nevening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber.\\r\\nThat\\u2019s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands\\r\\nyonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must\\r\\nbe inside here, and no possible mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQueequeg!\\u2014Queequeg!\\u201d\\u2014all still. Something must have happened.\\r\\nApoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.\\r\\nRunning down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first\\r\\nperson I met\\u2014the chamber-maid. \\u201cLa! la!\\u201d she cried, \\u201cI thought\\r\\nsomething must be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast,\\r\\nand the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it\\u2019s been\\r\\njust so silent ever since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone\\r\\noff and locked your baggage in for safe keeping. La! la,\\r\\nma\\u2019am!\\u2014Mistress! murder! Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!\\u201d\\u2014and with these\\r\\ncries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\\r\\nvinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation\\r\\nof attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy meantime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWood-house!\\u201d cried I, \\u201cwhich way to it? Run for God\\u2019s sake, and\\r\\nfetch something to pry open the door\\u2014the axe!\\u2014the axe! he\\u2019s had a\\r\\nstroke; depend upon it!\\u201d\\u2014and so saying I was unmethodically\\r\\nrushing up stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the\\r\\nmustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter with you, young man?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGet the axe! For God\\u2019s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I\\r\\npry it open!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook here,\\u201d said the landlady, quickly putting down the\\r\\nvinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; \\u201clook here; are you\\r\\ntalking about prying open any of my doors?\\u201d\\u2014and with that she seized\\r\\nmy arm. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter with you? What\\u2019s the matter with you,\\r\\nshipmate?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand the\\r\\nwhole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of her\\r\\nnose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed\\u2014\\u201cNo! I haven\\u2019t\\r\\nseen it since I put it there.\\u201d Running to a little closet under the\\r\\nlanding of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that\\r\\nQueequeg\\u2019s harpoon was missing. \\u201cHe\\u2019s killed himself,\\u201d she\\r\\ncried. \\u201cIt\\u2019s unfort\\u2019nate Stiggs done over again\\u2014there goes\\r\\nanother counterpane\\u2014God pity his poor mother!\\u2014it will be the ruin\\r\\nof my house. Has the poor lad a sister? Where\\u2019s that girl?\\u2014there,\\r\\nBetty, go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a\\r\\nsign, with\\u2014\\u201cno suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the\\r\\nparlor;\\u201d\\u2014might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be\\r\\nmerciful to his ghost! What\\u2019s that noise there? You, young man, avast\\r\\nthere!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force\\r\\nopen the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t allow it; I won\\u2019t have my premises spoiled. Go for the\\r\\nlocksmith, there\\u2019s one about a mile from here. But avast!\\u201d putting\\r\\nher hand in her side-pocket, \\u201chere\\u2019s a key that\\u2019ll fit, I guess;\\r\\nlet\\u2019s see.\\u201d And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas!\\r\\nQueequeg\\u2019s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHave to burst it open,\\u201d said I, and was running down the entry a\\r\\nlittle, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing\\r\\nI should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a\\r\\nsudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming\\r\\nagainst the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good\\r\\nheavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right\\r\\nin the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on\\r\\ntop of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat\\r\\nlike a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQueequeg,\\u201d said I, going up to him, \\u201cQueequeg, what\\u2019s the\\r\\nmatter with you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe hain\\u2019t been a sittin\\u2019 so all day, has he?\\u201d said the\\r\\nlandlady.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt\\r\\nlike pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\\r\\nintolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\\r\\nespecially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\\r\\neight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMrs. Hussey,\\u201d said I, \\u201che\\u2019s alive at all events; so leave us,\\r\\nif you please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nClosing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\\r\\nQueequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\\r\\ndo\\u2014for all my polite arts and blandishments\\u2014he would not move a peg,\\r\\nnor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in\\r\\nthe slightest way.\\r\\n\\r\\nI wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\\r\\nthey fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;\\r\\nyes, it\\u2019s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest;\\r\\nhe\\u2019ll get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can\\u2019t last for ever,\\r\\nthank God, and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don\\u2019t believe\\r\\nit\\u2019s very punctual then.\\r\\n\\r\\nI went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\\r\\nstories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as\\r\\nthey called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,\\r\\nconfined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after\\r\\nlistening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o\\u2019clock, I went\\r\\nup stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must\\r\\ncertainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he\\r\\nwas just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to\\r\\ngrow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be\\r\\nsitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\\r\\nholding a piece of wood on his head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFor heaven\\u2019s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and\\r\\nhave some supper. You\\u2019ll starve; you\\u2019ll kill yourself, Queequeg.\\u201d\\r\\nBut not a word did he reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nDespairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\\r\\nand no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\\r\\nturning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\\r\\nit promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary\\r\\nround jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into\\r\\nthe faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of\\r\\nQueequeg\\u2014not four feet off\\u2014sitting there in that uneasy position,\\r\\nstark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think of\\r\\nit; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his\\r\\nhams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\\r\\nday; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\\r\\nhad been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\\r\\nsun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints,\\r\\nbut with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\\r\\nforehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person\\u2019s religion,\\r\\nbe it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\\r\\nother person, because that other person don\\u2019t believe it also. But\\r\\nwhen a man\\u2019s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive\\r\\ntorment to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable\\r\\ninn to lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside\\r\\nand argue the point with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd just so I now did with Queequeg. \\u201cQueequeg,\\u201d said I, \\u201cget into\\r\\nbed now, and lie and listen to me.\\u201d I then went on, beginning with\\r\\nthe rise and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the\\r\\nvarious religions of the present time, during which time I labored\\r\\nto show Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged\\r\\nham-squattings in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the\\r\\nhealth; useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of\\r\\nHygiene and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things\\r\\nsuch an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very\\r\\nbadly pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this\\r\\nridiculous Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body\\r\\ncave in; hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast\\r\\nmust necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic\\r\\nreligionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In\\r\\none word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first\\r\\nborn on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through\\r\\nthe hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\\r\\n\\r\\nI then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\\r\\ndyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\\r\\nin. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\\r\\nfeast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\\r\\nwherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o\\u2019clock in the\\r\\nafternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo more, Queequeg,\\u201d said I, shuddering; \\u201cthat will do;\\u201d for\\r\\nI knew the inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a\\r\\nsailor who had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the\\r\\ncustom, when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the\\r\\nslain in the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they\\r\\nwere placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,\\r\\nwith breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,\\r\\nwere sent round with the victor\\u2019s compliments to all his friends, just\\r\\nas though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\\r\\nimpression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed\\r\\ndull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his\\r\\nown point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one\\r\\nthird understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he\\r\\nno doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than\\r\\nI did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and\\r\\ncompassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible\\r\\nyoung man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\\r\\nbreakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\\r\\nmake much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\\r\\nPequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 18. His Mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg\\r\\ncarrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us\\r\\nfrom his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,\\r\\nand furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft,\\r\\nunless they previously produced their papers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?\\u201d said I, now jumping on\\r\\nthe bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI mean,\\u201d he replied, \\u201che must show his papers.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head\\r\\nfrom behind Peleg\\u2019s, out of the wigwam. \\u201cHe must show that he\\u2019s\\r\\nconverted. Son of darkness,\\u201d he added, turning to Queequeg, \\u201cart\\r\\nthou at present in communion with any Christian church?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy,\\u201d said I, \\u201che\\u2019s a member of the first Congregational\\r\\nChurch.\\u201d Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in\\r\\nNantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFirst Congregational Church,\\u201d cried Bildad, \\u201cwhat! that worships\\r\\nin Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman\\u2019s meeting-house?\\u201d and so saying,\\r\\ntaking out his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana\\r\\nhandkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the\\r\\nwigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at\\r\\nQueequeg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow long hath he been a member?\\u201d he then said, turning to me;\\r\\n\\u201cnot very long, I rather guess, young man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo,\\u201d said Peleg, \\u201cand he hasn\\u2019t been baptized right either, or\\r\\nit would have washed some of that devil\\u2019s blue off his face.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo tell, now,\\u201d cried Bildad, \\u201cis this Philistine a regular member\\r\\nof Deacon Deuteronomy\\u2019s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I\\r\\npass it every Lord\\u2019s day.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,\\u201d\\r\\nsaid I; \\u201call I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the\\r\\nFirst Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYoung man,\\u201d said Bildad sternly, \\u201cthou art skylarking with\\r\\nme\\u2014explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean?\\r\\nanswer me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFinding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. \\u201cI mean, sir, the same\\r\\nancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and\\r\\nQueequeg here, and all of us, and every mother\\u2019s son and soul of\\r\\nus belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole\\r\\nworshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some\\r\\nqueer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in that we all join\\r\\nhands.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSplice, thou mean\\u2019st splice hands,\\u201d cried Peleg, drawing nearer.\\r\\n\\u201cYoung man, you\\u2019d better ship for a missionary, instead of a\\r\\nfore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy\\u2014why\\r\\nFather Mapple himself couldn\\u2019t beat it, and he\\u2019s reckoned something.\\r\\nCome aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell\\r\\nQuohog there\\u2014what\\u2019s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By\\r\\nthe great anchor, what a harpoon he\\u2019s got there! looks like good stuff\\r\\nthat; and he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your\\r\\nname is, did you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever\\r\\nstrike a fish?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWithout saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon\\r\\nthe bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats\\r\\nhanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his\\r\\nharpoon, cried out in some such way as this:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCap\\u2019ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him?\\r\\nwell, spose him one whale eye, well, den!\\u201d and taking sharp aim at it,\\r\\nhe darted the iron right over old Bildad\\u2019s broad brim, clean across\\r\\nthe ship\\u2019s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow,\\u201d said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, \\u201cspos-ee him\\r\\nwhale-e eye; why, dad whale dead.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQuick, Bildad,\\u201d said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close\\r\\nvicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin gangway.\\r\\n\\u201cQuick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship\\u2019s papers. We must have\\r\\nHedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye, Quohog,\\r\\nwe\\u2019ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that\\u2019s more than ever was given\\r\\na harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon\\r\\nenrolled among the same ship\\u2019s company to which I myself belonged.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for\\r\\nsigning, he turned to me and said, \\u201cI guess, Quohog there don\\u2019t know\\r\\nhow to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name\\r\\nor make thy mark?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken\\r\\npart in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the\\r\\noffered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact\\r\\ncounterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm;\\r\\nso that through Captain Peleg\\u2019s obstinate mistake touching his\\r\\nappellative, it stood something like this:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\nQuohog. his X mark.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,\\r\\nand at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his\\r\\nbroad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one\\r\\nentitled \\u201cThe Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,\\u201d placed it in\\r\\nQueequeg\\u2019s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,\\r\\nlooked earnestly into his eyes, and said, \\u201cSon of darkness, I must do\\r\\nmy duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for\\r\\nthe souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,\\r\\nwhich I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial\\r\\nbondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the\\r\\nwrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer clear\\r\\nof the fiery pit!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad\\u2019s language,\\r\\nheterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our\\r\\nharpooneer,\\u201d cried Peleg. \\u201cPious harpooneers never make good\\r\\nvoyagers\\u2014it takes the shark out of \\u2018em; no harpooneer is worth a\\r\\nstraw who aint pretty sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the\\r\\nbravest boat-header out of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the\\r\\nmeeting, and never came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy\\r\\nsoul, that he shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of\\r\\nafter-claps, in case he got stove and went to Davy Jones.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPeleg! Peleg!\\u201d said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, \\u201cthou\\r\\nthyself, as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest,\\r\\nPeleg, what it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can\\u2019st thou\\r\\nprate in this ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell\\r\\nme, when this same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that\\r\\ntyphoon on Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain\\r\\nAhab, did\\u2019st thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHear him, hear him now,\\u201d cried Peleg, marching across the cabin,\\r\\nand thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,\\u2014\\u201chear him, all\\r\\nof ye. Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink!\\r\\nDeath and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an\\r\\neverlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us,\\r\\nfore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think\\r\\nabout Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of;\\r\\nand how to save all hands\\u2014how to rig jury-masts\\u2014how to get into the\\r\\nnearest port; that was what I was thinking of.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck,\\r\\nwhere we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some\\r\\nsailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then\\r\\nhe stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which\\r\\notherwise might have been wasted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 19. The Prophet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nQueequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from\\r\\nthe water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when\\r\\nthe above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,\\r\\nlevelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but\\r\\nshabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a\\r\\nblack handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all\\r\\ndirections flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated ribbed\\r\\nbed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHave ye shipped in her?\\u201d he repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,\\u201d said I, trying to gain a\\r\\nlittle more time for an uninterrupted look at him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, the Pequod\\u2014that ship there,\\u201d he said, drawing back his whole\\r\\narm, and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed\\r\\nbayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d said I, \\u201cwe have just signed the articles.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnything down there about your souls?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAbout what?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, perhaps you hav\\u2019n\\u2019t got any,\\u201d he said quickly. \\u201cNo matter\\r\\nthough, I know many chaps that hav\\u2019n\\u2019t got any,\\u2014good luck to\\r\\n\\u2018em; and they are all the better off for it. A soul\\u2019s a sort of a\\r\\nfifth wheel to a wagon.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat are you jabbering about, shipmate?\\u201d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that\\r\\nsort in other chaps,\\u201d abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous\\r\\nemphasis upon the word he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQueequeg,\\u201d said I, \\u201clet\\u2019s go; this fellow has broken loose\\r\\nfrom somewhere; he\\u2019s talking about something and somebody we don\\u2019t\\r\\nknow.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStop!\\u201d cried the stranger. \\u201cYe said true\\u2014ye hav\\u2019n\\u2019t seen\\r\\nOld Thunder yet, have ye?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho\\u2019s Old Thunder?\\u201d said I, again riveted with the insane\\r\\nearnestness of his manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Ahab.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye\\r\\nhav\\u2019n\\u2019t seen him yet, have ye?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, we hav\\u2019n\\u2019t. He\\u2019s sick they say, but is getting better, and\\r\\nwill be all right again before long.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll right again before long!\\u201d laughed the stranger, with a solemnly\\r\\nderisive sort of laugh. \\u201cLook ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then\\r\\nthis left arm of mine will be all right; not before.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat do you know about him?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat did they tell you about him? Say that!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey didn\\u2019t tell much of anything about him; only I\\u2019ve heard that\\r\\nhe\\u2019s a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s true, that\\u2019s true\\u2014yes, both true enough. But you must\\r\\njump when he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go\\u2014that\\u2019s the\\r\\nword with Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to\\r\\nhim off Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and\\r\\nnights; nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the\\r\\naltar in Santa?\\u2014heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver\\r\\ncalabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last voyage,\\r\\naccording to the prophecy. Didn\\u2019t ye hear a word about them matters\\r\\nand something more, eh? No, I don\\u2019t think ye did; how could ye? Who\\r\\nknows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows\\u2019ever, mayhap, ye\\u2019ve\\r\\nheard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of\\r\\nthat, I dare say. Oh yes, that every one knows a\\u2019most\\u2014I mean they\\r\\nknow he\\u2019s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy friend,\\u201d said I, \\u201cwhat all this gibberish of yours is about, I\\r\\ndon\\u2019t know, and I don\\u2019t much care; for it seems to me that you must\\r\\nbe a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain\\r\\nAhab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know\\r\\nall about the loss of his leg.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll about it, eh\\u2014sure you do?\\u2014all?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPretty sure.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like\\r\\nstranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a\\r\\nlittle, turned and said:\\u2014\\u201cYe\\u2019ve shipped, have ye? Names down on\\r\\nthe papers? Well, well, what\\u2019s signed, is signed; and what\\u2019s to\\r\\nbe, will be; and then again, perhaps it won\\u2019t be, after all. Anyhow,\\r\\nit\\u2019s all fixed and arranged a\\u2019ready; and some sailors or other must\\r\\ngo with him, I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity \\u2018em!\\r\\nMorning to ye, shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I\\u2019m\\r\\nsorry I stopped ye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook here, friend,\\u201d said I, \\u201cif you have anything important to\\r\\ntell us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you\\r\\nare mistaken in your game; that\\u2019s all I have to say.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd it\\u2019s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that\\r\\nway; you are just the man for him\\u2014the likes of ye. Morning to ye,\\r\\nshipmates, morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell \\u2018em I\\u2019ve concluded\\r\\nnot to make one of \\u2018em.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAh, my dear fellow, you can\\u2019t fool us that way\\u2014you can\\u2019t fool\\r\\nus. It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had\\r\\na great secret in him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMorning to ye, shipmates, morning.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMorning it is,\\u201d said I. \\u201cCome along, Queequeg, let\\u2019s leave this\\r\\ncrazy man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cElijah.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nElijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each\\r\\nother\\u2019s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he\\r\\nwas nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone\\r\\nperhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and\\r\\nlooking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,\\r\\nthough at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I\\r\\nsaid nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my\\r\\ncomrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner\\r\\nthat we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging\\r\\nus, but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This\\r\\ncircumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,\\r\\nshrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments\\r\\nand half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain\\r\\nAhab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver\\r\\ncalabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship\\r\\nthe day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the voyage\\r\\nwe had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy things.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really\\r\\ndogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,\\r\\nand on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on, without\\r\\nseeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and finally as it\\r\\nseemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 20. All Astir.\\r\\n\\r\\nA day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.\\r\\nNot only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on\\r\\nboard, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything\\r\\nbetokened that the ship\\u2019s preparations were hurrying to a close.\\r\\nCaptain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam keeping\\r\\na sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing and\\r\\nproviding at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on the\\r\\nrigging were working till long after night-fall.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the day following Queequeg\\u2019s signing the articles, word was given\\r\\nat all the inns where the ship\\u2019s company were stopping, that their\\r\\nchests must be on board before night, for there was no telling how\\r\\nsoon the vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,\\r\\nresolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they\\r\\nalways give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail\\r\\nfor several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and\\r\\nthere is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod\\r\\nwas fully equipped.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery one knows what a multitude of things\\u2014beds, sauce-pans, knives\\r\\nand forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are\\r\\nindispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,\\r\\nwhich necessitates a three-years\\u2019 housekeeping upon the wide ocean,\\r\\nfar from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And\\r\\nthough this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means\\r\\nto the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of the\\r\\nwhaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the\\r\\nfishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors\\r\\nusually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling\\r\\nvessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially\\r\\nto the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of\\r\\nthe voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare spars, and spare\\r\\nlines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but a spare Captain\\r\\nand duplicate ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the\\r\\nPequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,\\r\\nfuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time\\r\\nthere was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and\\r\\nends of things, both large and small.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain\\r\\nBildad\\u2019s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and\\r\\nindefatigable spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved\\r\\nthat, if she could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the\\r\\nPequod, after once fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come\\r\\non board with a jar of pickles for the steward\\u2019s pantry; another time\\r\\nwith a bunch of quills for the chief mate\\u2019s desk, where he kept his\\r\\nlog; a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some one\\u2019s\\r\\nrheumatic back. Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was\\r\\nCharity\\u2014Aunt Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister\\r\\nof charity did this charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and\\r\\nthither, ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to\\r\\nyield safety, comfort, and consolation to all on board a ship in which\\r\\nher beloved brother Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned\\r\\na score or two of well-saved dollars.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on\\r\\nboard, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and\\r\\na still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor\\r\\nCaptain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him\\r\\na long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down\\r\\nwent his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a\\r\\nwhile Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men\\r\\ndown the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and then\\r\\nconcluded by roaring back into his wigwam.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the\\r\\ncraft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when\\r\\nhe was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would\\r\\nanswer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard\\r\\nevery day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend\\r\\nto everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been\\r\\ndownright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart\\r\\nthat I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage,\\r\\nwithout once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute\\r\\ndictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.\\r\\nBut when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be\\r\\nalready involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his\\r\\nsuspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I said\\r\\nnothing, and tried to think nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\\r\\ncertainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was nearly six o\\u2019clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we\\r\\ndrew nigh the wharf.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\\u201d said I\\r\\nto Queequeg, \\u201cit can\\u2019t be shadows; she\\u2019s off by sunrise, I guess;\\r\\ncome on!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast!\\u201d cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close\\r\\nbehind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating\\r\\nhimself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain\\r\\ntwilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGoing aboard?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHands off, will you,\\u201d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLookee here,\\u201d said Queequeg, shaking himself, \\u201cgo \\u2018way!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAin\\u2019t going aboard, then?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, we are,\\u201d said I, \\u201cbut what business is that of yours? Do you\\r\\nknow, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, no, no; I wasn\\u2019t aware of that,\\u201d said Elijah, slowly and\\r\\nwonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable\\r\\nglances.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cElijah,\\u201d said I, \\u201cyou will oblige my friend and me by\\r\\nwithdrawing. We are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would\\r\\nprefer not to be detained.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYe be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s cracked, Queequeg,\\u201d said I, \\u201ccome on.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHolloa!\\u201d cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a\\r\\nfew paces.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNever mind him,\\u201d said I, \\u201cQueequeg, come on.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my\\r\\nshoulder, said\\u2014\\u201cDid ye see anything looking like men going towards\\r\\nthat ship a while ago?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nStruck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying,\\r\\n\\u201cYes, I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be\\r\\nsure.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery dim, very dim,\\u201d said Elijah. \\u201cMorning to ye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and\\r\\ntouching my shoulder again, said, \\u201cSee if you can find \\u2018em now, will\\r\\nye?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFind who?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMorning to ye! morning to ye!\\u201d he rejoined, again moving\\r\\noff. \\u201cOh! I was going to warn ye against\\u2014but never mind, never\\r\\nmind\\u2014it\\u2019s all one, all in the family too;\\u2014sharp frost this\\r\\nmorning, ain\\u2019t it? Good-bye to ye. Shan\\u2019t see ye again very soon,\\r\\nI guess; unless it\\u2019s before the Grand Jury.\\u201d And with these cracked\\r\\nwords he finally departed, leaving me, for the moment, in no small\\r\\nwonderment at his frantic impudence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound\\r\\nquiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\\r\\nhatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\\r\\nto the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\\r\\nlight, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\\r\\ntattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\\r\\nface downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\\r\\nslept upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThose sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\\u201d said\\r\\nI, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the\\r\\nwharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence\\r\\nI would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that\\r\\nmatter, were it not for Elijah\\u2019s otherwise inexplicable question. But\\r\\nI beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted\\r\\nto Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him\\r\\nto establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper\\u2019s\\r\\nrear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more\\r\\nado, sat quietly down there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGracious! Queequeg, don\\u2019t sit there,\\u201d said I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! perry dood seat,\\u201d said Queequeg, \\u201cmy country way; won\\u2019t\\r\\nhurt him face.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFace!\\u201d said I, \\u201ccall that his face? very benevolent countenance\\r\\nthen; but how hard he breathes, he\\u2019s heaving himself; get off,\\r\\nQueequeg, you are heavy, it\\u2019s grinding the face of the poor. Get\\r\\noff, Queequeg! Look, he\\u2019ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don\\u2019t\\r\\nwake.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nQueequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\\r\\nlighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\\r\\nover the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him\\r\\nin his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\\r\\nland, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\\r\\nchiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some\\r\\nof the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in\\r\\nthat respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay\\r\\nthem round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on\\r\\nan excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible\\r\\ninto walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\\r\\ndesiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps\\r\\nin some damp marshy place.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\\r\\nfrom me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper\\u2019s head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that for, Queequeg?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPerry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\\r\\nwhich, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\\r\\nhis soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\\r\\nstrong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began\\r\\nto tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\\r\\ntroubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\\r\\nrubbed his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHolloa!\\u201d he breathed at last, \\u201cwho be ye smokers?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShipped men,\\u201d answered I, \\u201cwhen does she sail?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\\r\\ncame aboard last night.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat Captain?\\u2014Ahab?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho but him indeed?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we\\r\\nheard a noise on deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHolloa! Starbuck\\u2019s astir,\\u201d said the rigger. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a lively\\r\\nchief mate, that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn\\r\\nto.\\u201d And so saying he went on deck, and we followed.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and\\r\\nthrees; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\\r\\nengaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various\\r\\nlast things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly\\r\\nenshrined within his cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship\\u2019s\\r\\nriggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and\\r\\nafter the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with her\\r\\nlast gift\\u2014a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her brother-in-law,\\r\\nand a spare Bible for the steward\\u2014after all this, the two Captains,\\r\\nPeleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to the chief mate,\\r\\nPeleg said:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is\\r\\nall ready\\u2014just spoke to him\\u2014nothing more to be got from shore, eh?\\r\\nWell, call all hands, then. Muster \\u2018em aft here\\u2014blast \\u2018em!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,\\u201d said\\r\\nBildad, \\u201cbut away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHow now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\\r\\nPeleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the\\r\\nquarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as\\r\\nwell as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of\\r\\nhim was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then,\\r\\nthe idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the\\r\\nship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was\\r\\nnot at all his proper business, but the pilot\\u2019s; and as he was not\\r\\nyet completely recovered\\u2014so they said\\u2014therefore, Captain Ahab stayed\\r\\nbelow. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant\\r\\nservice many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable\\r\\ntime after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,\\r\\nhaving a farewell merry-making with their shore friends, before they\\r\\nquit the ship for good with the pilot.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\\r\\nPeleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and\\r\\ncommanding, and not Bildad.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAft here, ye sons of bachelors,\\u201d he cried, as the sailors lingered\\r\\nat the main-mast. \\u201cMr. Starbuck, drive\\u2019em aft.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStrike the tent there!\\u201d\\u2014was the next order. As I hinted before,\\r\\nthis whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board\\r\\nthe Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well\\r\\nknown to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMan the capstan! Blood and thunder!\\u2014jump!\\u201d\\u2014was the next\\r\\ncommand, and the crew sprang for the handspikes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\\r\\nis the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it\\r\\nknown, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots\\r\\nof the port\\u2014he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in\\r\\norder to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned\\r\\nin, for he never piloted any other craft\\u2014Bildad, I say, might now\\r\\nbe seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching\\r\\nanchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,\\r\\nto cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of\\r\\na chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will.\\r\\nNevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no\\r\\nprofane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\\r\\ngetting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\\r\\ncopy of Watts in each seaman\\u2019s berth.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\\r\\nand swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would\\r\\nsink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused\\r\\non my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the\\r\\nperils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a\\r\\npilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious\\r\\nBildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and\\r\\nturning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the\\r\\nact of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first\\r\\nkick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs that the way they heave in the marchant service?\\u201d he roared.\\r\\n\\u201cSpring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don\\u2019t\\r\\nye spring, I say, all of ye\\u2014spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with\\r\\nthe red whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants.\\r\\nSpring, I say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!\\u201d And so saying,\\r\\nhe moved along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely,\\r\\nwhile imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,\\r\\nCaptain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\\r\\nwas a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into\\r\\nnight, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\\r\\nfreezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\\r\\nteeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white\\r\\nivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from\\r\\nthe bows.\\r\\n\\r\\nLank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the\\r\\nold craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost\\r\\nall over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady\\r\\nnotes were heard,\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living\\r\\ngreen. So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNever did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They\\r\\nwere full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in the\\r\\nboisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was\\r\\nyet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads\\r\\nand glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,\\r\\nuntrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed\\r\\nno longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\\r\\nalongside.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at\\r\\nthis juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;\\r\\nvery loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a\\r\\nvoyage\\u2014beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of\\r\\nhis hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate\\r\\nsailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to\\r\\nencounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to\\r\\na thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,\\u2014poor old Bildad\\r\\nlingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the\\r\\ncabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and\\r\\nlooked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only\\r\\nbounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards\\r\\nthe land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere\\r\\nand nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,\\r\\nconvulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,\\r\\nfor a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,\\r\\n\\u201cNevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\\r\\nhis philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the\\r\\nlantern came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to\\r\\ndeck\\u2014now a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about\\r\\nhim,\\u2014\\u201cCaptain Bildad\\u2014come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the\\r\\nmain-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!\\r\\nCareful, careful!\\u2014come, Bildad, boy\\u2014say your last. Luck to ye,\\r\\nStarbuck\\u2014luck to ye, Mr. Stubb\\u2014luck to ye, Mr. Flask\\u2014good-bye and\\r\\ngood luck to ye all\\u2014and this day three years I\\u2019ll have a hot supper\\r\\nsmoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGod bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,\\u201d murmured old\\r\\nBildad, almost incoherently. \\u201cI hope ye\\u2019ll have fine weather now, so\\r\\nthat Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye\\u2014a pleasant sun is all\\r\\nhe needs, and ye\\u2019ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.\\r\\nBe careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don\\u2019t stave the boats needlessly,\\r\\nye harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.\\r\\nwithin the year. Don\\u2019t forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind\\r\\nthat cooper don\\u2019t waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in\\r\\nthe green locker! Don\\u2019t whale it too much a\\u2019 Lord\\u2019s days, men; but\\r\\ndon\\u2019t miss a fair chance either, that\\u2019s rejecting Heaven\\u2019s good\\r\\ngifts. Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little\\r\\nleaky, I thought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of\\r\\nfornication. Good-bye, good-bye! Don\\u2019t keep that cheese too long\\r\\ndown in the hold, Mr. Starbuck; it\\u2019ll spoil. Be careful with the\\r\\nbutter\\u2014twenty cents the pound it was, and mind ye, if\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,\\u2014away!\\u201d and with\\r\\nthat, Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nShip and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a\\r\\nscreaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave\\r\\nthree heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone\\r\\nAtlantic.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded\\r\\nmariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen on that shivering winter\\u2019s night, the Pequod thrust her\\r\\nvindictive bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see\\r\\nstanding at her helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and\\r\\nfearfulness upon the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four\\r\\nyears\\u2019 dangerous voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for\\r\\nstill another tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet.\\r\\nWonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no\\r\\nepitaphs; this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington.\\r\\nLet me only say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship,\\r\\nthat miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain\\r\\ngive succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,\\r\\nhearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that\\u2019s kind to our\\r\\nmortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship\\u2019s\\r\\ndirest jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land, though\\r\\nit but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and through.\\r\\nWith all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing, fights\\r\\n\\u2018gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks all\\r\\nthe lashed sea\\u2019s landlessness again; for refuge\\u2019s sake forlornly\\r\\nrushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!\\r\\n\\r\\nKnow ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally\\r\\nintolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid\\r\\neffort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while\\r\\nthe wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the\\r\\ntreacherous, slavish shore?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,\\r\\nindefinite as God\\u2014so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,\\r\\nthan be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety!\\r\\nFor worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of\\r\\nthe terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart,\\r\\nO Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy\\r\\nocean-perishing\\u2014straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 24. The Advocate.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;\\r\\nand as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among\\r\\nlandsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I\\r\\nam all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby done\\r\\nto us hunters of whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish\\r\\nthe fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not\\r\\naccounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a\\r\\nstranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,\\r\\nit would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were\\r\\nhe presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation\\r\\nof the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm\\r\\nWhale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed\\r\\npre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.\\r\\n\\r\\nDoubtless one leading reason why the world declines honouring us\\r\\nwhalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a\\r\\nbutchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we\\r\\nare surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is\\r\\ntrue. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been\\r\\nall Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honour. And\\r\\nas for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall\\r\\nsoon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown,\\r\\nand which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship\\r\\nat least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even\\r\\ngranting the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery\\r\\ndecks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of\\r\\nthose battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in\\r\\nall ladies\\u2019 plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much enhances the\\r\\npopular conceit of the soldier\\u2019s profession; let me assure ye that\\r\\nmany a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would quickly\\r\\nrecoil at the apparition of the sperm whale\\u2019s vast tail, fanning into\\r\\neddies the air over his head. For what are the comprehensible terrors of\\r\\nman compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it\\r\\nunwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding\\r\\nadoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn round\\r\\nthe globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of\\r\\nscales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy did the Dutch in De Witt\\u2019s time have admirals of their whaling\\r\\nfleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit\\r\\nout whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some\\r\\nscore or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did\\r\\nBritain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties\\r\\nupwards of L1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of\\r\\nAmerica now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;\\r\\nsail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen\\r\\nthousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,\\r\\nat the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our\\r\\nharbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if\\r\\nthere be not something puissant in whaling?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is not the half; look again.\\r\\n\\r\\nI freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,\\r\\npoint out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty\\r\\nyears has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken in\\r\\none aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way\\r\\nand another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so\\r\\ncontinuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may\\r\\nwell be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves\\r\\npregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to\\r\\ncatalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past\\r\\nthe whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and\\r\\nleast known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes\\r\\nwhich had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If\\r\\nAmerican and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage\\r\\nharbors, let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the\\r\\nwhale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted\\r\\nbetween them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the heroes\\r\\nof Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I say that\\r\\nscores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket, that were\\r\\nas great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern. For in their\\r\\nsuccourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish sharked waters,\\r\\nand by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands, battled with virgin\\r\\nwonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines and muskets would\\r\\nnot willingly have dared. All that is made such a flourish of in the old\\r\\nSouth Sea Voyages, those things were but the life-time commonplaces of\\r\\nour heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures which Vancouver dedicates\\r\\nthree chapters to, these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the\\r\\nship\\u2019s common log. Ah, the world! Oh, the world!\\r\\n\\r\\nUntil the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,\\r\\nscarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe and\\r\\nthe long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific coast.\\r\\nIt was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the\\r\\nSpanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted, it\\r\\nmight be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the\\r\\nliberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain, and\\r\\nthe establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was given\\r\\nto the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first blunder-born\\r\\ndiscovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores\\r\\nas pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The\\r\\nwhale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover,\\r\\nin the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were\\r\\nseveral times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the\\r\\nwhale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted\\r\\nisles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage\\r\\nto the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the\\r\\nmerchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their\\r\\nfirst destinations. If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become\\r\\nhospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due;\\r\\nfor already she is on the threshold.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no\\r\\naesthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to\\r\\nshiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet\\r\\nevery time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you\\r\\nwill say.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler? Who wrote\\r\\nthe first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who composed\\r\\nthe first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a prince than\\r\\nAlfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down the words from\\r\\nOther, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And who pronounced our\\r\\nglowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!\\r\\n\\r\\nTrue enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no\\r\\ngood blood in their veins.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo good blood in their veins? They have something better than royal\\r\\nblood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;\\r\\nafterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers\\r\\nof Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and\\r\\nharpooneers\\u2014all kith and kin to noble Benjamin\\u2014this day darting the\\r\\nbarbed iron from one side of the world to the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nGood again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not\\r\\nrespectable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhaling not respectable? Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory\\r\\nlaw, the whale is declared \\u201ca royal fish.\\u201d *\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, that\\u2019s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any\\r\\ngrand imposing way.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whale never figured in any grand imposing way? In one of the mighty\\r\\ntriumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world\\u2019s\\r\\ncapital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian\\r\\ncoast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.\\r\\n\\r\\nGrant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real\\r\\ndignity in whaling.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo dignity in whaling? The dignity of our calling the very heavens\\r\\nattest. Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your\\r\\nhat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I\\r\\nknow a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty\\r\\nwhales. I account that man more honourable than that great captain of\\r\\nantiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet undiscovered\\r\\nprime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute in that small\\r\\nbut high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably ambitious of; if\\r\\nhereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a man might rather\\r\\nhave done than to have left undone; if, at my death, my executors, or\\r\\nmore properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in my desk, then here\\r\\nI prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling; for a\\r\\nwhale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 25. Postscript.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but\\r\\nsubstantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who\\r\\nshould wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might\\r\\ntell eloquently upon his cause\\u2014such an advocate, would he not be\\r\\nblameworthy?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern\\r\\nones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is\\r\\ngone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may\\r\\nbe a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely\\u2014who knows?\\r\\nCertain I am, however, that a king\\u2019s head is solemnly oiled at his\\r\\ncoronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they\\r\\nanoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint\\r\\nmachinery? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential\\r\\ndignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but\\r\\nmeanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably\\r\\nsmells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil,\\r\\nunless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him\\r\\nsomewhere. As a general rule, he can\\u2019t amount to much in his totality.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the only thing to be considered here, is this\\u2014what kind of oil is\\r\\nused at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil,\\r\\nnor castor oil, nor bear\\u2019s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What\\r\\nthen can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted\\r\\nstate, the sweetest of all oils?\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and\\r\\nqueens with coronation stuff!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a\\r\\nQuaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy\\r\\ncoast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard\\r\\nas twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would\\r\\nnot spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of\\r\\ngeneral drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which\\r\\nhis state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those\\r\\nsummers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his\\r\\nthinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and\\r\\ncares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely\\r\\nthe condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the\\r\\ncontrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped\\r\\nup in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength, like a revivified\\r\\nEgyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come,\\r\\nand to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like\\r\\na patent chronometer, his interior vitality was warranted to do well\\r\\nin all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet\\r\\nlingering images of those thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted\\r\\nthrough life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a\\r\\ntelling pantomime of action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for\\r\\nall his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there were certain qualities\\r\\nin him which at times affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to\\r\\noverbalance all the rest. Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and\\r\\nendued with a deep natural reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his\\r\\nlife did therefore strongly incline him to superstition; but to that\\r\\nsort of superstition, which in some organizations seems rather to\\r\\nspring, somehow, from intelligence than from ignorance. Outward portents\\r\\nand inward presentiments were his. And if at times these things bent the\\r\\nwelded iron of his soul, much more did his far-away domestic memories\\r\\nof his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend him still more from the\\r\\noriginal ruggedness of his nature, and open him still further to those\\r\\nlatent influences which, in some honest-hearted men, restrain the gush\\r\\nof dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in the more perilous\\r\\nvicissitudes of the fishery. \\u201cI will have no man in my boat,\\u201d said\\r\\nStarbuck, \\u201cwho is not afraid of a whale.\\u201d By this, he seemed to\\r\\nmean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which\\r\\narises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an\\r\\nutterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye,\\u201d said Stubb, the second mate, \\u201cStarbuck, there, is as\\r\\ncareful a man as you\\u2019ll find anywhere in this fishery.\\u201d But we shall\\r\\nere long see what that word \\u201ccareful\\u201d precisely means when used by a\\r\\nman like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a\\r\\nsentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon all\\r\\nmortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in this\\r\\nbusiness of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits of\\r\\nthe ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly wasted.\\r\\nWherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sun-down; nor\\r\\nfor persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting\\r\\nhim. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical ocean to kill\\r\\nwhales for my living, and not to be killed by them for theirs; and that\\r\\nhundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew. What doom was his\\r\\nown father\\u2019s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could he find the torn\\r\\nlimbs of his brother?\\r\\n\\r\\nWith memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain\\r\\nsuperstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which\\r\\ncould, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But\\r\\nit was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such\\r\\nterrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature\\r\\nthat these things should fail in latently engendering an element in\\r\\nhim, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its\\r\\nconfinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it\\r\\nwas that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,\\r\\nwhile generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or\\r\\nwhales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet\\r\\ncannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,\\r\\nwhich sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and\\r\\nmighty man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete\\r\\nabasement of poor Starbuck\\u2019s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart\\r\\nto write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose\\r\\nthe fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint\\r\\nstock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;\\r\\nmen may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble\\r\\nand so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any\\r\\nignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their\\r\\ncostliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves,\\r\\nso far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character\\r\\nseem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of\\r\\na valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,\\r\\ncompletely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But this\\r\\naugust dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes, but\\r\\nthat abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt see it\\r\\nshining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that democratic\\r\\ndignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God; Himself! The\\r\\ngreat God absolute! The centre and circumference of all democracy! His\\r\\nomnipresence, our divine equality!\\r\\n\\r\\nIf, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall\\r\\nhereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic\\r\\ngraces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among them\\r\\nall, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall\\r\\ntouch that workman\\u2019s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a\\r\\nrainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics\\r\\nbear me out in it, thou Just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one\\r\\nroyal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou great\\r\\ndemocratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict, Bunyan, the\\r\\npale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves\\r\\nof finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old Cervantes; Thou who\\r\\ndidst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who didst hurl him upon a\\r\\nwar-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a throne! Thou who, in all\\r\\nThy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest Thy selectest champions from\\r\\nthe kingly commons; bear me out in it, O God!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\\r\\naccording to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;\\r\\nneither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an\\r\\nindifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the\\r\\nchase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged\\r\\nfor the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his\\r\\nwhale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his\\r\\ncrew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\\r\\narrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the\\r\\nsnugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of\\r\\nthe fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as\\r\\na whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes\\r\\nwhile flank and flank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had,\\r\\nfor this Stubb, converted the jaws of death into an easy chair. What he\\r\\nthought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of\\r\\nit at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his\\r\\nmind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor,\\r\\nhe took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir\\r\\nthemselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed\\r\\nthe order, and not sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\\r\\nunfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\\r\\nworld full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;\\r\\nwhat helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that\\r\\nthing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black\\r\\nlittle pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\\r\\nalmost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\\r\\nnose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\\r\\nloaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he\\r\\nturned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\\r\\nthe other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\\r\\nreadiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\\r\\nlegs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\\r\\npeculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether\\r\\nashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of\\r\\nthe numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the\\r\\ncholera, some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their\\r\\nmouths; so, likewise, against all mortal tribulations, Stubb\\u2019s tobacco\\r\\nsmoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha\\u2019s Vineyard. A\\r\\nshort, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\\r\\nwho somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\\r\\nand hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\\r\\nhonour with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\\r\\nwas he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic\\r\\nbulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\\r\\nany possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,\\r\\nthe wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\\r\\nwater-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\\r\\napplication of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\\r\\nignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\\r\\nthe matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\\r\\nthree years\\u2019 voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\\r\\nthat length of time. As a carpenter\\u2019s nails are divided into wrought\\r\\nnails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\\r\\nwas one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\\r\\ncalled him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could\\r\\nbe well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic\\r\\nwhalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted\\r\\ninto it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those\\r\\nbattering seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow these three mates\\u2014Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous\\r\\nmen. They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the\\r\\nPequod\\u2019s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which\\r\\nCaptain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales,\\r\\nthese three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with\\r\\ntheir long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers;\\r\\neven as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic\\r\\nKnight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,\\r\\nwho in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when\\r\\nthe former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\\r\\nmoreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\\r\\nand friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set\\r\\ndown who the Pequod\\u2019s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of\\r\\nthem belonged.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected\\r\\nfor his squire. But Queequeg is already known.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly\\r\\npromontory of Martha\\u2019s Vineyard, where there still exists the last\\r\\nremnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the neighboring\\r\\nisland of Nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers. In\\r\\nthe fishery, they usually go by the generic name of Gay-Headers.\\r\\nTashtego\\u2019s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones, and black\\r\\nrounding eyes\\u2014for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but\\r\\nAntarctic in their glittering expression\\u2014all this sufficiently\\r\\nproclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud\\r\\nwarrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had\\r\\nscoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer\\r\\nsnuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now\\r\\nhunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon\\r\\nof the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look at\\r\\nthe tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have credited\\r\\nthe superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and half-believed\\r\\nthis wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers of the Air.\\r\\nTashtego was Stubb the second mate\\u2019s squire.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\\r\\nnegro-savage, with a lion-like tread\\u2014an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended\\r\\nfrom his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\\r\\nthem ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to\\r\\nthem. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\\r\\nlying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been\\r\\nanywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors\\r\\nmost frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\\r\\nlife of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\\r\\nmanner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,\\r\\nand erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\\r\\nfeet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\\r\\nhim; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\\r\\nbeg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus\\r\\nDaggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man\\r\\nbeside him. As for the residue of the Pequod\\u2019s company, be it said,\\r\\nthat at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before\\r\\nthe mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans born,\\r\\nthough pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same with\\r\\nthe American whale fishery as with the American army and military and\\r\\nmerchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the construction\\r\\nof the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say, because in all\\r\\nthese cases the native American liberally provides the brains, the rest\\r\\nof the world as generously supplying the muscles. No small number of\\r\\nthese whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the outward bound\\r\\nNantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy\\r\\npeasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the Greenland whalers\\r\\nsailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland Islands, to\\r\\nreceive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage homewards,\\r\\nthey drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but\\r\\nIslanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders\\r\\nin the Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging the common\\r\\ncontinent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate continent of his\\r\\nown. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were!\\r\\nAn Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all\\r\\nthe ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the\\r\\nworld\\u2019s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them\\r\\never come back. Black Little Pip\\u2014he never did\\u2014oh, no! he went\\r\\nbefore. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod\\u2019s forecastle, ye shall\\r\\nere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time,\\r\\nwhen sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in\\r\\nwith angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here,\\r\\nhailed a hero there!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 28. Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was seen\\r\\nof Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the watches,\\r\\nand for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed to be the\\r\\nonly commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from the cabin\\r\\nwith orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was plain they\\r\\nbut commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and dictator was\\r\\nthere, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate\\r\\ninto the now sacred retreat of the cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly\\r\\ngazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague\\r\\ndisquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the\\r\\nsea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at\\r\\ntimes by the ragged Elijah\\u2019s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly\\r\\nrecurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived\\r\\nof. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was\\r\\nalmost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish\\r\\nprophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or\\r\\nuneasiness\\u2014to call it so\\u2014which I felt, yet whenever I came to look\\r\\nabout me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\\r\\nemotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\\r\\nwere a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\\r\\ntame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\\r\\nacquainted with, still I ascribed this\\u2014and rightly ascribed it\\u2014to\\r\\nthe fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian\\r\\nvocation in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially\\r\\nthe aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which\\r\\nwas most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and\\r\\ninduce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.\\r\\nThree better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own\\r\\ndifferent way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of\\r\\nthem Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being\\r\\nChristmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had\\r\\nbiting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the\\r\\nsouthward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,\\r\\ngradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable weather\\r\\nbehind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy\\r\\nenough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the ship\\r\\nwas rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and\\r\\nmelancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of the\\r\\nforenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the taffrail,\\r\\nforeboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension; Captain\\r\\nAhab stood upon his quarter-deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\\r\\nrecovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\\r\\nthe fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\\r\\nor taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\\r\\nwhole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\\r\\nunalterable mould, like Cellini\\u2019s cast Perseus. Threading its way out\\r\\nfrom among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\\r\\ntawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing,\\r\\nyou saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\\r\\nperpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of\\r\\na great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\\r\\nwithout wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top\\r\\nto bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly\\r\\nalive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it\\r\\nwas the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.\\r\\nBy some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was\\r\\nmade to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego\\u2019s senior, an\\r\\nold Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not\\r\\ntill he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and\\r\\nthen it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in\\r\\nan elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\\r\\nnegatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,\\r\\nwho, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this\\r\\nlaid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the\\r\\nimmemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with\\r\\npreternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously\\r\\ncontradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should\\r\\nbe tranquilly laid out\\u2014which might hardly come to pass, so he\\r\\nmuttered\\u2014then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would\\r\\nfind a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid\\r\\nbrand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted\\r\\nthat not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric\\r\\nwhite leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that\\r\\nthis ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the\\r\\nsperm whale\\u2019s jaw. \\u201cAye, he was dismasted off Japan,\\u201d said the\\r\\nold Gay-Head Indian once; \\u201cbut like his dismasted craft, he shipped\\r\\nanother mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of \\u2018em.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nI was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side\\r\\nof the Pequod\\u2019s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,\\r\\nthere was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank.\\r\\nHis bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by\\r\\na shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the\\r\\nship\\u2019s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude,\\r\\na determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,\\r\\nforward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his\\r\\nofficers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures\\r\\nand expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful,\\r\\nconsciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that,\\r\\nbut moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his\\r\\nface; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.\\r\\nBut after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either\\r\\nstanding in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or\\r\\nheavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to\\r\\ngrow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as\\r\\nif, when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry\\r\\nbleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it\\r\\ncame to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,\\r\\nfor all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck,\\r\\nhe seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was\\r\\nonly making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling\\r\\npreparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so\\r\\nthat there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite\\r\\nAhab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that\\r\\nlayer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose the\\r\\nloftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the\\r\\npleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him from\\r\\nhis mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and May,\\r\\ntrip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest, ruggedest,\\r\\nmost thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some few green\\r\\nsprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did, in the\\r\\nend, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air. More\\r\\nthan once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look, which, in any\\r\\nother man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now\\r\\nwent rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost\\r\\nperpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the Tropic.\\r\\nThe warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing, redundant days,\\r\\nwere as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped up\\u2014flaked up, with\\r\\nrose-water snow. The starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in\\r\\njewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely pride, the memory of their\\r\\nabsent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted suns! For sleeping man,\\r\\n\\u2018twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing\\r\\nnights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely\\r\\nlend new spells and potencies to the outward world. Inward they turned\\r\\nupon the soul, especially when the still mild hours of eve came on;\\r\\nthen, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless\\r\\ntwilights. And all these subtle agencies, more and more they wrought on\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s texture.\\r\\n\\r\\nOld age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less\\r\\nman has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,\\r\\nthe old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the\\r\\nnight-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he\\r\\nseemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits\\r\\nwere more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. \\u201cIt\\r\\nfeels like going down into one\\u2019s tomb,\\u201d\\u2014he would mutter to\\r\\nhimself\\u2014\\u201cfor an old captain like me to be descending this narrow\\r\\nscuttle, to go to my grave-dug berth.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were\\r\\nset, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;\\r\\nand when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors\\r\\nflung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt\\r\\nit to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when\\r\\nthis sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the\\r\\nsilent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old man\\r\\nwould emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled way.\\r\\nSome considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like these,\\r\\nhe usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because to his\\r\\nwearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel, such\\r\\nwould have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step, that\\r\\ntheir dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks. But once,\\r\\nthe mood was on him too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy,\\r\\nlumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast,\\r\\nStubb, the old second mate, came up from below, with a certain\\r\\nunassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if Captain Ahab was\\r\\npleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say nay; but there might\\r\\nbe some way of muffling the noise; hinting something indistinctly and\\r\\nhesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the insertion into it, of the\\r\\nivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know Ahab then.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAm I a cannon-ball, Stubb,\\u201d said Ahab, \\u201cthat thou wouldst wad me\\r\\nthat fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;\\r\\nwhere such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at\\r\\nlast.\\u2014Down, dog, and kennel!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly\\r\\nscornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,\\r\\n\\u201cI am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half\\r\\nlike it, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,\\r\\nas if to avoid some passionate temptation.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, sir; not yet,\\u201d said Stubb, emboldened, \\u201cI will not tamely be\\r\\ncalled a dog, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and\\r\\nbegone, or I\\u2019ll clear the world of thee!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors in\\r\\nhis aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,\\u201d\\r\\nmuttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle.\\r\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don\\u2019t well know\\r\\nwhether to go back and strike him, or\\u2014what\\u2019s that?\\u2014down here on my\\r\\nknees and pray for him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but\\r\\nit would be the first time I ever did pray. It\\u2019s queer; very queer;\\r\\nand he\\u2019s queer too; aye, take him fore and aft, he\\u2019s about the\\r\\nqueerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!\\u2014his\\r\\neyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway there\\u2019s something on his\\r\\nmind, as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks.\\r\\nHe aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours out of the\\r\\ntwenty-four; and he don\\u2019t sleep then. Didn\\u2019t that Dough-Boy, the\\r\\nsteward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man\\u2019s\\r\\nhammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the\\r\\nfoot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of\\r\\nfrightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I\\r\\nguess he\\u2019s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it\\u2019s a kind\\r\\nof Tic-Dolly-row they say\\u2014worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don\\u2019t\\r\\nknow what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He\\u2019s full of\\r\\nriddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night,\\r\\nas Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what\\u2019s that for, I should like\\r\\nto know? Who\\u2019s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain\\u2019t that\\r\\nqueer, now? But there\\u2019s no telling, it\\u2019s the old game\\u2014Here goes\\r\\nfor a snooze. Damn me, it\\u2019s worth a fellow\\u2019s while to be born into\\r\\nthe world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it,\\r\\nthat\\u2019s about the first thing babies do, and that\\u2019s a sort of queer,\\r\\ntoo. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of \\u2018em. But\\r\\nthat\\u2019s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment;\\r\\nand sleep when you can, is my twelfth\\u2014So here goes again. But how\\u2019s\\r\\nthat? didn\\u2019t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times a\\r\\ndonkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that! He might as well\\r\\nhave kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me, and I didn\\u2019t\\r\\nobserve it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It flashed\\r\\nlike a bleached bone. What the devil\\u2019s the matter with me? I don\\u2019t\\r\\nstand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of\\r\\nturned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,\\r\\nthough\\u2014How? how? how?\\u2014but the only way\\u2019s to stash it; so here\\r\\ngoes to hammock again; and in the morning, I\\u2019ll see how this plaguey\\r\\njuggling thinks over by daylight.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 30. The Pipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the\\r\\nbulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a sailor\\r\\nof the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also his pipe.\\r\\nLighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the\\r\\nweather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were\\r\\nfabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one\\r\\nlook at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking\\r\\nhim of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of\\r\\nthe sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome moments passed, during which the thick vapour came from his mouth\\r\\nin quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. \\u201cHow\\r\\nnow,\\u201d he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, \\u201cthis smoking\\r\\nno longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be\\r\\ngone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring\\u2014aye, and\\r\\nignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with\\r\\nsuch nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the\\r\\nstrongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe?\\r\\nThis thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapours\\r\\namong mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine. I\\u2019ll\\r\\nsmoke no more\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the\\r\\nwaves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe\\r\\nmade. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning Stubb accosted Flask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSuch a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man\\u2019s\\r\\nivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick\\r\\nback, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then,\\r\\npresto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking\\r\\nat it. But what was still more curious, Flask\\u2014you know how curious all\\r\\ndreams are\\u2014through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be\\r\\nthinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that\\r\\nkick from Ahab. \\u2018Why,\\u2019 thinks I, \\u2018what\\u2019s the row? It\\u2019s not a\\r\\nreal leg, only a false leg.\\u2019 And there\\u2019s a mighty difference between\\r\\na living thump and a dead thump. That\\u2019s what makes a blow from the\\r\\nhand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.\\r\\nThe living member\\u2014that makes the living insult, my little man. And\\r\\nthinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly\\r\\ntoes against that cursed pyramid\\u2014so confoundedly contradictory was it\\r\\nall, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, \\u2018what\\u2019s his leg\\r\\nnow, but a cane\\u2014a whalebone cane. Yes,\\u2019 thinks I, \\u2018it was only a\\r\\nplayful cudgelling\\u2014in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me\\u2014not\\r\\na base kick. Besides,\\u2019 thinks I, \\u2018look at it once; why, the end of\\r\\nit\\u2014the foot part\\u2014what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad\\r\\nfooted farmer kicked me, there\\u2019s a devilish broad insult. But this\\r\\ninsult is whittled down to a point only.\\u2019 But now comes the greatest\\r\\njoke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a\\r\\nsort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by\\r\\nthe shoulders, and slews me round. \\u2018What are you \\u2018bout?\\u2019 says he.\\r\\nSlid! man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment\\r\\nI was over the fright. \\u2018What am I about?\\u2019 says I at last. \\u2018And\\r\\nwhat business is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do\\r\\nyou want a kick?\\u2019 By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than\\r\\nhe turned round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of\\r\\nseaweed he had for a clout\\u2014what do you think, I saw?\\u2014why thunder\\r\\nalive, man, his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points\\r\\nout. Says I, on second thoughts, \\u2018I guess I won\\u2019t kick you, old\\r\\nfellow.\\u2019 \\u2018Wise Stubb,\\u2019 said he, \\u2018wise Stubb;\\u2019 and kept\\r\\nmuttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a\\r\\nchimney hag. Seeing he wasn\\u2019t going to stop saying over his \\u2018wise\\r\\nStubb, wise Stubb,\\u2019 I thought I might as well fall to kicking the\\r\\npyramid again. But I had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared\\r\\nout, \\u2018Stop that kicking!\\u2019 \\u2018Halloa,\\u2019 says I, \\u2018what\\u2019s the\\r\\nmatter now, old fellow?\\u2019 \\u2018Look ye here,\\u2019 says he; \\u2018let\\u2019s argue\\r\\nthe insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn\\u2019t he?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, he did,\\u2019\\r\\nsays I\\u2014\\u2018right here it was.\\u2019 \\u2018Very good,\\u2019 says he\\u2014\\u2018he\\r\\nused his ivory leg, didn\\u2019t he?\\u2019 \\u2018Yes, he did,\\u2019 says I. \\u2018Well\\r\\nthen,\\u2019 says he, \\u2018wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn\\u2019t\\r\\nhe kick with right good will? it wasn\\u2019t a common pitch pine leg he\\r\\nkicked with, was it? No, you were kicked by a great man, and with a\\r\\nbeautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It\\u2019s an honour; I consider it an honour.\\r\\nListen, wise Stubb. In old England the greatest lords think it great\\r\\nglory to be slapped by a queen, and made garter-knights of; but, be your\\r\\nboast, Stubb, that ye were kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of.\\r\\nRemember what I say; be kicked by him; account his kicks honours; and on\\r\\nno account kick back; for you can\\u2019t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don\\u2019t\\r\\nyou see that pyramid?\\u2019 With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow,\\r\\nin some queer fashion, to swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over;\\r\\nand there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream,\\r\\nFlask?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.\\u2019\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMay be; may be. But it\\u2019s made a wise man of me, Flask. D\\u2019ye see\\r\\nAhab standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best\\r\\nthing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to\\r\\nhim, whatever he says. Halloa! What\\u2019s that he shouts? Hark!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat do you think of that now, Flask? ain\\u2019t there a small drop of\\r\\nsomething queer about that, eh? A white whale\\u2014did ye mark that, man?\\r\\nLook ye\\u2014there\\u2019s something special in the wind. Stand by for it,\\r\\nFlask. Ahab has that that\\u2019s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes\\r\\nthis way.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 32. Cetology.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost\\r\\nin its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere the\\r\\nPequod\\u2019s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of\\r\\nthe leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost\\r\\nindispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more\\r\\nspecial leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to\\r\\nfollow.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,\\r\\nthat I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The\\r\\nclassification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here\\r\\nessayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled\\r\\nCetology,\\u201d says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the\\r\\ninquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups\\r\\nand families.... Utter confusion exists among the historians of this\\r\\nanimal\\u201d (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cUnfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.\\u201d\\r\\n\\u201cImpenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.\\u201d \\u201cA\\r\\nfield strewn with thorns.\\u201d \\u201cAll these incomplete indications but\\r\\nserve to torture us naturalists.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,\\r\\nthose lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real\\r\\nknowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in\\r\\nsome small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are\\r\\nthe men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at\\r\\nlarge or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:\\u2014The Authors\\r\\nof the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;\\r\\nRay; Linnaeus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;\\r\\nMarten; Lacepede; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick Cuvier;\\r\\nJohn Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne; the\\r\\nAuthor of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to what\\r\\nultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited\\r\\nextracts will show.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen\\r\\never saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional\\r\\nharpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate\\r\\nsubject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing\\r\\nauthority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great\\r\\nsperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy\\r\\nmentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper\\r\\nupon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest\\r\\nof the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the\\r\\nprofound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the\\r\\nthen fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to\\r\\nthis present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats\\r\\nand whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference\\r\\nto nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days,\\r\\nwill satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to\\r\\nthem the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new\\r\\nproclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,\\u2014the\\r\\nGreenland whale is deposed,\\u2014the great sperm whale now reigneth!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living\\r\\nsperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree\\r\\nsucceed in the attempt. Those books are Beale\\u2019s and Bennett\\u2019s; both\\r\\nin their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact\\r\\nand reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be\\r\\nfound in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,\\r\\nit is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific\\r\\ndescription. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,\\r\\nlives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted whales,\\r\\nhis is an unwritten life.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the various species of whales need some sort of popular\\r\\ncomprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the\\r\\npresent, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent\\r\\nlaborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I\\r\\nhereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;\\r\\nbecause any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very\\r\\nreason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical\\r\\ndescription of the various species, or\\u2014in this place at least\\u2014to\\r\\nmuch of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught\\r\\nof a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the Post-Office\\r\\nis equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea after them;\\r\\nto have one\\u2019s hands among the unspeakable foundations, ribs, and very\\r\\npelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I that I should\\r\\nessay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful tauntings in Job\\r\\nmight well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a covenant with thee?\\r\\nBehold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam through libraries and\\r\\nsailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible\\r\\nhands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to\\r\\nsettle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\\r\\nis in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\\r\\nstill remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\\r\\nNature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \\u201cI hereby separate the whales\\r\\nfrom the fish.\\u201d But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the\\r\\nyear 1850, sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus\\u2019s\\r\\nexpress edict, were still found dividing the possession of the same seas\\r\\nwith the Leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from\\r\\nthe waters, he states as follows: \\u201cOn account of their warm bilocular\\r\\nheart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\\r\\nintrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\\u201d and finally, \\u201cex lege naturae\\r\\njure meritoque.\\u201d I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey\\r\\nand Charley Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain\\r\\nvoyage, and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were\\r\\naltogether insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\\r\\nground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\\r\\nThis fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\\r\\nrespect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given\\r\\nyou those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\\r\\nwhereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\\r\\nconspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\\r\\nwhale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail. There you have\\r\\nhim. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\\r\\nmeditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\\r\\nfish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\\r\\nstill more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\\r\\nnoticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\\r\\nvertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\\r\\nthough it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\\r\\nposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\\r\\nfrom the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\\r\\nwith the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\\r\\nhand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.*\\r\\nHence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be\\r\\nincluded in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand\\r\\ndivisions of the entire whale host.\\r\\n\\r\\n*I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and\\r\\nDugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included\\r\\nby many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy,\\r\\ncontemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on\\r\\nwet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials\\r\\nas whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the\\r\\nKingdom of Cetology.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary\\r\\nBOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them all,\\r\\nboth small and large.\\r\\n\\r\\nI. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the type of the FOLIO I present the Sperm Whale; of the OCTAVO, the\\r\\nGrampus; of the DUODECIMO, the Porpoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nFOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:\\u2014I. The\\r\\nSperm Whale; II. the Right Whale; III. the Fin-Back Whale; IV. the\\r\\nHump-backed Whale; V. the Razor-Back Whale; VI. the Sulphur-Bottom\\r\\nWhale.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER I. (Sperm Whale).\\u2014This whale, among the\\r\\nEnglish of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter\\r\\nwhale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the\\r\\nFrench, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the\\r\\nLong Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;\\r\\nthe most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in\\r\\naspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being\\r\\nthe only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is\\r\\nobtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged\\r\\nupon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically\\r\\nconsidered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was\\r\\nalmost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil\\r\\nwas only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days\\r\\nspermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a\\r\\ncreature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland\\r\\nor Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was that\\r\\nquickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of\\r\\nthe word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was\\r\\nexceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment\\r\\nand medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays\\r\\nbuy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of time, the\\r\\ntrue nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was still\\r\\nretained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so\\r\\nstrangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation must at\\r\\nlast have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti\\r\\nwas really derived.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER II. (Right Whale).\\u2014In one respect this is the\\r\\nmost venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly hunted\\r\\nby man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen;\\r\\nand the oil specially known as \\u201cwhale oil,\\u201d an inferior article in\\r\\ncommerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by all\\r\\nthe following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black Whale;\\r\\nthe Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a deal of\\r\\nobscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously\\r\\nbaptised. What then is the whale, which I include in the second species\\r\\nof my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the English naturalists; the\\r\\nGreenland Whale of the English whalemen; the Baleine Ordinaire of the\\r\\nFrench whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the Swedes. It is the whale\\r\\nwhich for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and\\r\\nEnglish in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen\\r\\nhave long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the\\r\\nNor\\u2019 West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by\\r\\nthem Right Whale Cruising Grounds.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the\\r\\nEnglish and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree\\r\\nin all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single\\r\\ndeterminate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by\\r\\nendless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that\\r\\nsome departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The\\r\\nright whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference\\r\\nto elucidating the sperm whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER III. (Fin-Back).\\u2014Under this head I reckon\\r\\na monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\\r\\nLong-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\\r\\nwhose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\\r\\nAtlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and\\r\\nin his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\\r\\nportly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips\\r\\npresent a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds\\r\\nof large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which\\r\\nhe derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some\\r\\nthree or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the\\r\\nback, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if\\r\\nnot the slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated\\r\\nfin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When\\r\\nthe sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples,\\r\\nand this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled\\r\\nsurface, it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it\\r\\nsomewhat resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on\\r\\nit. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not\\r\\ngregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very\\r\\nshy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the\\r\\nremotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet\\r\\nrising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with\\r\\nsuch wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present\\r\\npursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable\\r\\nCain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From\\r\\nhaving the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with\\r\\nthe right whale, among a theoretic species denominated Whalebone Whales,\\r\\nthat is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there\\r\\nwould seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little\\r\\nknown. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched\\r\\nwhales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen\\u2019s\\r\\nnames for a few sorts.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn connection with this appellative of \\u201cWhalebone whales,\\u201d it is\\r\\nof great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be\\r\\nconvenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\\r\\nin vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon\\r\\neither his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those\\r\\nmarked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford\\r\\nthe basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached\\r\\nbodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How\\r\\nthen? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\\r\\npeculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\\r\\nwithout any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other\\r\\nand more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\\r\\nwhale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same\\r\\nhumpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen;\\r\\nbut there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the\\r\\nother parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such\\r\\nirregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached,\\r\\nsuch an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general\\r\\nmethodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the\\r\\nwhale-naturalists has split.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the\\r\\nwhale, in his anatomy\\u2014there, at least, we shall be able to hit the\\r\\nright classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the\\r\\nGreenland whale\\u2019s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have\\r\\nseen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the\\r\\nGreenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various\\r\\nleviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as\\r\\navailable to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated.\\r\\nWhat then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily, in\\r\\ntheir entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way. And this is\\r\\nthe Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only one that can\\r\\npossibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (Folio) CHAPTER IV. (Hump-Back).\\u2014This whale is often seen on\\r\\nthe northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there, and\\r\\ntowed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or you\\r\\nmight call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the popular\\r\\nname for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the sperm\\r\\nwhale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very\\r\\nvaluable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of\\r\\nall the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any\\r\\nother of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER V. (Razor-Back).\\u2014Of this whale little is\\r\\nknown but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of\\r\\na retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no\\r\\ncoward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which rises\\r\\nin a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor does\\r\\nanybody else.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK I. (Folio), CHAPTER VI. (Sulphur-Bottom).\\u2014Another retiring\\r\\ngentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the\\r\\nTartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;\\r\\nat least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas,\\r\\nand then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is\\r\\nnever chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are\\r\\ntold of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true\\r\\nof ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus ends BOOK I. (Folio), and now begins BOOK II. (Octavo).\\r\\n\\r\\nOCTAVOES.*\\u2014These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which\\r\\npresent may be numbered:\\u2014I., the Grampus; II., the Black Fish; III.,\\r\\nthe Narwhale; IV., the Thrasher; V., the Killer.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.\\r\\nBecause, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of\\r\\nthe former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them\\r\\nin figure, yet the bookbinder\\u2019s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form\\r\\ndoes not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume\\r\\ndoes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER I. (Grampus).\\u2014Though this fish, whose\\r\\nloud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb\\r\\nto landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not\\r\\npopularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand distinctive\\r\\nfeatures of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised him for one.\\r\\nHe is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to twenty-five feet\\r\\nin length, and of corresponding dimensions round the waist. He swims in\\r\\nherds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil is considerable in\\r\\nquantity, and pretty good for light. By some fishermen his approach is\\r\\nregarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER II. (Black Fish).\\u2014I give the popular\\r\\nfishermen\\u2019s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.\\r\\nWhere any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so,\\r\\nand suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,\\r\\nbecause blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the\\r\\nHyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the\\r\\ncircumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he\\r\\ncarries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale\\r\\naverages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost\\r\\nall latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin\\r\\nin swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more\\r\\nprofitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the Hyena\\r\\nwhale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employment\\u2014as\\r\\nsome frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and quite alone by\\r\\nthemselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax. Though their\\r\\nblubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of\\r\\nthirty gallons of oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER III. (Narwhale), that is, Nostril\\r\\nwhale.\\u2014Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose\\r\\nfrom his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The\\r\\ncreature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five\\r\\nfeet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly\\r\\nspeaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw\\r\\nin a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only\\r\\nfound on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner\\r\\nsomething analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What\\r\\nprecise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to\\r\\nsay. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and\\r\\nbill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for\\r\\na rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin\\r\\nsaid it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the\\r\\nsurface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his\\r\\nhorn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these\\r\\nsurmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided\\r\\nhorn may really be used by the Narwhale\\u2014however that may be\\u2014it would\\r\\ncertainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.\\r\\nThe Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale, and\\r\\nthe Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the Unicornism\\r\\nto be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From certain\\r\\ncloistered old authors I have gathered that this same sea-unicorn\\u2019s\\r\\nhorn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison,\\r\\nand as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It was also\\r\\ndistilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way that the\\r\\nhorns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn. Originally it\\r\\nwas in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black Letter tells\\r\\nme that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage, when\\r\\nQueen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of\\r\\nGreenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; \\u201cwhen Sir\\r\\nMartin returned from that voyage,\\u201d saith Black Letter, \\u201con bended\\r\\nknees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the\\r\\nNarwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle at\\r\\nWindsor.\\u201d An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended\\r\\nknees, did likewise present to her highness another horn, pertaining to\\r\\na land beast of the unicorn nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a\\r\\nmilk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.\\r\\nHis oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it, and\\r\\nhe is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER IV. (Killer).\\u2014Of this whale little is\\r\\nprecisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed\\r\\nnaturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say\\r\\nthat he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage\\u2014a sort\\r\\nof Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip,\\r\\nand hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.\\r\\nThe Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.\\r\\nException might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the\\r\\nground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on\\r\\nsea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK II. (Octavo), CHAPTER V. (Thrasher).\\u2014This gentleman is famous for\\r\\nhis tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He mounts\\r\\nthe Folio whale\\u2019s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by\\r\\nflogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar\\r\\nprocess. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both\\r\\nare outlaws, even in the lawless seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus ends BOOK II. (Octavo), and begins BOOK III. (Duodecimo).\\r\\n\\r\\nDUODECIMOES.\\u2014These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise.\\r\\nII. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may\\r\\npossibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five\\r\\nfeet should be marshalled among WHALES\\u2014a word, which, in the popular\\r\\nsense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set\\r\\ndown above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my\\r\\ndefinition of what a whale is\\u2014i.e. a spouting fish, with a horizontal\\r\\ntail.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER 1. (Huzza Porpoise).\\u2014This is the\\r\\ncommon porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own\\r\\nbestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something\\r\\nmust be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always\\r\\nswims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing\\r\\nthemselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their\\r\\nappearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of fine\\r\\nspirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward. They\\r\\nare the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted a\\r\\nlucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding\\r\\nthese vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly\\r\\ngamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will\\r\\nyield you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid\\r\\nextracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among\\r\\njewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise\\r\\nmeat is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that\\r\\na porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very\\r\\nreadily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him; and\\r\\nyou will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER II. (Algerine Porpoise).\\u2014A pirate. Very\\r\\nsavage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat larger\\r\\nthan the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make. Provoke him,\\r\\nand he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many times, but\\r\\nnever yet saw him captured.\\r\\n\\r\\nBOOK III. (Duodecimo), CHAPTER III. (Mealy-mouthed Porpoise).\\u2014The\\r\\nlargest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it is\\r\\nknown. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been designated,\\r\\nis that of the fishers\\u2014Right-Whale Porpoise, from the circumstance\\r\\nthat he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In shape, he\\r\\ndiffers in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a less rotund\\r\\nand jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and gentleman-like\\r\\nfigure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises have), he has\\r\\na lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel hue. But his\\r\\nmealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his side fins is\\r\\nof a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark in a ship\\u2019s\\r\\nhull, called the \\u201cbright waist,\\u201d that line streaks him from stem to\\r\\nstern, with two separate colours, black above and white below. The white\\r\\ncomprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which makes him\\r\\nlook as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a meal-bag.\\r\\nA most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of the common\\r\\nporpoise.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as\\r\\nthe Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the\\r\\nLeviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,\\r\\nhalf-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by\\r\\nreputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their\\r\\nfore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to\\r\\nfuture investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If\\r\\nany of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then\\r\\nhe can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio,\\r\\nOctavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:\\u2014The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale;\\r\\nthe Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon\\r\\nWhale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the\\r\\nIceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,\\r\\nDutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of\\r\\nuncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I omit\\r\\nthem as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for\\r\\nmere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be\\r\\nhere, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have\\r\\nkept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus\\r\\nunfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the\\r\\ncrane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small\\r\\nerections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true\\r\\nones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever\\r\\ncompleting anything. This whole book is but a draught\\u2014nay, but the\\r\\ndraught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\\r\\nas any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\\r\\nfrom the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\\r\\nof course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe large importance attached to the harpooneer\\u2019s vocation is evinced\\r\\nby the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\\r\\nand more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\\r\\nthe person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\\r\\nofficer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\\r\\nusage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those\\r\\ndays, the captain\\u2019s authority was restricted to the navigation\\r\\nand general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\\r\\ndepartment and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\\r\\nreigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\\r\\ntitle of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\\r\\nhis former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as\\r\\nsenior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain\\u2019s more\\r\\ninferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\\r\\nharpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\\r\\nin the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,\\r\\nbut under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the\\r\\ncommand of the ship\\u2019s deck is also his; therefore the grand political\\r\\nmaxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from\\r\\nthe men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their\\r\\nprofessional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as\\r\\ntheir social equal.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\\r\\nthis\\u2014the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\\r\\nmerchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and\\r\\nso, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in\\r\\nthe after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in the\\r\\ncaptain\\u2019s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest\\r\\nof all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and\\r\\nthe community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high\\r\\nor low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their\\r\\ncommon luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and\\r\\nhard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less\\r\\nrigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind\\r\\nhow much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some\\r\\nprimitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious\\r\\nexternals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,\\r\\nand in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in\\r\\nwhich you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated\\r\\ngrandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost\\r\\nas much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the\\r\\nshabbiest of pilot-cloth.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least\\r\\ngiven to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage\\r\\nhe ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he\\r\\nrequired no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon\\r\\nthe quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar\\r\\ncircumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he\\r\\naddressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or in\\r\\nterrorem, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means\\r\\nunobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those\\r\\nforms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally\\r\\nmaking use of them for other and more private ends than they were\\r\\nlegitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of his brain,\\r\\nwhich had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through\\r\\nthose forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible\\r\\ndictatorship. For be a man\\u2019s intellectual superiority what it will,\\r\\nit can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men,\\r\\nwithout the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always,\\r\\nin themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever\\r\\nkeeps God\\u2019s true princes of the Empire from the world\\u2019s hustings;\\r\\nand leaves the highest honours that this air can give, to those men\\r\\nwho become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the\\r\\nchoice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted\\r\\nsuperiority over the dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks\\r\\nin these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them,\\r\\nthat in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted\\r\\npotency. But when, as in the case of Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown\\r\\nof geographical empire encircles an imperial brain; then, the plebeian\\r\\nherds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization. Nor, will the\\r\\ntragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest\\r\\nsweep and direct swing, ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in\\r\\nhis art, as the one now alluded to.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket\\r\\ngrimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and\\r\\nKings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old\\r\\nwhale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings\\r\\nand housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it\\r\\nmust needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and\\r\\nfeatured in the unbodied air!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale loaf-of-bread\\r\\nface from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord and\\r\\nmaster; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking an\\r\\nobservation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the\\r\\nsmooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on\\r\\nthe upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the\\r\\ntidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But\\r\\npresently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to\\r\\nthe deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, \\u201cDinner, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck,\\u201d disappears into the cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the last echo of his sultan\\u2019s step has died away, and Starbuck,\\r\\nthe first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then\\r\\nStarbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,\\r\\nand, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of\\r\\npleasantness, \\u201cDinner, Mr. Stubb,\\u201d and descends the scuttle. The\\r\\nsecond Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking\\r\\nthe main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important\\r\\nrope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid \\u201cDinner,\\r\\nMr. Flask,\\u201d follows after his predecessors.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,\\r\\nseems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all\\r\\nsorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his\\r\\nshoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\\r\\nover the Grand Turk\\u2019s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\\r\\nhis cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\\r\\nfar at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\\r\\nprocessions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into\\r\\nthe cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,\\r\\nthen, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab\\u2019s presence,\\r\\nin the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense\\r\\nartificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck\\r\\nsome officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and\\r\\ndefyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those\\r\\nvery officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that\\r\\nsame commander\\u2019s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say\\r\\ndeprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of\\r\\nthe table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this\\r\\ndifference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of\\r\\nBabylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,\\r\\ntherein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he\\r\\nwho in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own\\r\\nprivate dinner-table of invited guests, that man\\u2019s unchallenged power\\r\\nand dominion of individual influence for the time; that man\\u2019s royalty\\r\\nof state transcends Belshazzar\\u2019s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.\\r\\nWho has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Caesar.\\r\\nIt is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.\\r\\nNow, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of\\r\\na ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that\\r\\npeculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nOver his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned\\r\\nsea-lion on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still\\r\\ndeferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be\\r\\nserved. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,\\r\\nthere seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,\\r\\ntheir intent eyes all fastened upon the old man\\u2019s knife, as he carved\\r\\nthe chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they\\r\\nwould have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even\\r\\nupon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his\\r\\nknife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab thereby\\r\\nmotioned Starbuck\\u2019s plate towards him, the mate received his meat as\\r\\nthough receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little started\\r\\nif, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed it\\r\\nnoiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like\\r\\nthe Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly\\r\\ndines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were\\r\\nsomehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab\\r\\nforbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief it was\\r\\nto choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And\\r\\npoor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary\\r\\nfamily party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\\r\\nbeen the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this\\r\\nmust have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had\\r\\nhe helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have\\r\\nbeen able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,\\r\\nstrange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself,\\r\\nthe chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did\\r\\nFlask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners\\r\\nof the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,\\r\\nsunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such\\r\\nmarketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for\\r\\nhim, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\\r\\nis the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask\\u2019s dinner was badly\\r\\njammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\\r\\nand yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\\r\\neven, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\\r\\nappetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\\r\\nmust bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day;\\r\\nfor it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.\\r\\nTherefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he\\r\\nhad arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never\\r\\nknown what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what\\r\\nhe ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.\\r\\nPeace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from\\r\\nmy stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\\r\\nold-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before\\r\\nthe mast. There\\u2019s the fruits of promotion now; there\\u2019s the vanity of\\r\\nglory: there\\u2019s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that\\r\\nany mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask\\u2019s\\r\\nofficial capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample\\r\\nvengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask through\\r\\nthe cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\\r\\nin the Pequod\\u2019s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\\r\\norder to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\\r\\nrestored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three\\r\\nharpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees.\\r\\nThey made a sort of temporary servants\\u2019 hall of the high and mighty\\r\\ncabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\\r\\ninvisible domineerings of the captain\\u2019s table, was the entire\\r\\ncare-free license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those\\r\\ninferior fellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed\\r\\nafraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers\\r\\nchewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They\\r\\ndined like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all\\r\\nday loading with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and\\r\\nTashtego, that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast,\\r\\noften the pale Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of\\r\\nsalt-junk, seemingly quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not\\r\\nlively about it, if he did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then\\r\\nTashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork\\r\\nat his back, harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor,\\r\\nassisted Dough-Boy\\u2019s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting\\r\\nhis head into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in\\r\\nhand, began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He\\r\\nwas naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this\\r\\nbread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital\\r\\nnurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific\\r\\nAhab, and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,\\r\\nDough-Boy\\u2019s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after\\r\\nseeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he\\r\\nwould escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and\\r\\nfearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was\\r\\nover.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\\r\\nhis filed teeth to the Indian\\u2019s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on\\r\\nthe floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to\\r\\nthe low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low\\r\\ncabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in\\r\\na ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\\r\\nnot to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\\r\\nsmall mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,\\r\\nbaronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed\\r\\nstrong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his\\r\\ndilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\\r\\nbeef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\\r\\nmortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating\\u2014an ugly sound enough\\u2014so\\r\\nmuch so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether\\r\\nany marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\\r\\nTashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be\\r\\npicked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging\\r\\nround him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the\\r\\nwhetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\\r\\nlances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\\r\\nwould ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at\\r\\nall tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his\\r\\nIsland days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some\\r\\nmurderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the\\r\\nwhite waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on\\r\\nhis arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight,\\r\\nthe three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,\\r\\nfable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every\\r\\nstep, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\\r\\nthere; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\\r\\nscarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\\r\\nwhen they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\\r\\ncaptains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\\r\\nthe ship\\u2019s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone\\r\\nthat anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real\\r\\ntruth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be\\r\\nsaid to have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter\\r\\nit, it was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards\\r\\nfor a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\\r\\nresiding in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\\r\\nwas no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\\r\\nincluded in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\\r\\nlived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\\r\\nMissouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of\\r\\nthe woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter\\r\\nthere, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age,\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon\\r\\nthe sullen paws of its gloom!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\\r\\nother seamen my first mast-head came round.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\\r\\nsimultaneously with the vessel\\u2019s leaving her port; even though she may\\r\\nhave fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\\r\\ncruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years\\u2019 voyage\\r\\nshe is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her\\u2014say, an empty vial\\r\\neven\\u2014then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not\\r\\ntill her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she\\r\\naltogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very\\r\\nancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here.\\r\\nI take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\\r\\nEgyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\\r\\nFor though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\\r\\ntheir tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\\r\\nor Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\\r\\nstone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread\\r\\ngale of God\\u2019s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders\\r\\npriority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of\\r\\nmast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among\\r\\narchaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical\\r\\npurposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like\\r\\nformation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious\\r\\nlong upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount\\r\\nto the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a\\r\\nmodern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In\\r\\nSaint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him\\r\\na lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of\\r\\nhis life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a\\r\\ntackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\\r\\nstander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs\\r\\nor frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to\\r\\nthe last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads\\r\\nwe have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who,\\r\\nthough well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely\\r\\nincompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange\\r\\nsight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome,\\r\\nstands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;\\r\\ncareless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe, Louis\\r\\nBlanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft\\r\\non his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules\\u2019\\r\\npillars, his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few\\r\\nmortals will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands\\r\\nhis mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that\\r\\nLondon smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for\\r\\nwhere there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor\\r\\nNapoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however\\r\\nmadly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks\\r\\nupon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits\\r\\npenetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals\\r\\nand what rocks must be shunned.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\\r\\nstanders of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\\r\\nnot so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\\r\\nhistorian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\\r\\nthat in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\\r\\nlaunched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty\\r\\nspars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means\\r\\nof nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few\\r\\nyears ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand,\\r\\nwho, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh\\r\\nthe beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the\\r\\none proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads\\r\\nare kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their\\r\\nregular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two\\r\\nhours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant\\r\\nthe mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There\\r\\nyou stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the\\r\\ndeep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and\\r\\nbetween your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even\\r\\nas ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old\\r\\nRhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with\\r\\nnothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the\\r\\ndrowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the\\r\\nmost part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\\r\\nyou; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts\\r\\nof commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear\\r\\nof no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are\\r\\nnever troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner\\u2014for\\r\\nall your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and\\r\\nyour bill of fare is immutable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years\\u2019\\r\\nvoyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\\r\\nmast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\\r\\ndeplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\\r\\nof the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute\\r\\nof anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\\r\\ncomfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\\r\\na hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\\r\\nand snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\\r\\nmost usual point of perch is the head of the t\\u2019 gallant-mast, where\\r\\nyou stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)\\r\\ncalled the t\\u2019 gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the\\r\\nbeginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull\\u2019s horns.\\r\\nTo be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in\\r\\nthe shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat\\r\\nis no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued\\r\\ninside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor\\r\\neven move out of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an\\r\\nignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat\\r\\nis not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin\\r\\nencasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body,\\r\\nand no more can you make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\\r\\nsouthern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\\r\\npulpits, called crow\\u2019s-nests, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\\r\\nwhaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\\r\\nthe fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \\u201cA Voyage among\\r\\nthe Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\\r\\nre-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\\u201d in\\r\\nthis admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with\\r\\na charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\\r\\ncrow\\u2019s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet\\u2019s\\r\\ngood craft. He called it the Sleet\\u2019s crow\\u2019s-nest, in honour of\\r\\nhimself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all\\r\\nridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children\\r\\nafter our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and\\r\\npatentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any\\r\\nother apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet\\u2019s crow\\u2019s-nest is\\r\\nsomething like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where\\r\\nit is furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your\\r\\nhead in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend\\r\\ninto it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side,\\r\\nor side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker\\r\\nunderneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather\\r\\nrack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other\\r\\nnautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head\\r\\nin this crow\\u2019s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle\\r\\nwith him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and\\r\\nshot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea\\r\\nunicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at\\r\\nthem from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot\\r\\ndown upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of\\r\\nlove for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed\\r\\nconveniences of his crow\\u2019s-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many\\r\\nof these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his\\r\\nexperiments in this crow\\u2019s-nest, with a small compass he kept there\\r\\nfor the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is\\r\\ncalled the \\u201clocal attraction\\u201d of all binnacle magnets; an error\\r\\nascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship\\u2019s\\r\\nplanks, and in the Glacier\\u2019s case, perhaps, to there having been so\\r\\nmany broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the\\r\\nCaptain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned\\r\\n\\u201cbinnacle deviations,\\u201d \\u201cazimuth compass observations,\\u201d and\\r\\n\\u201capproximate errors,\\u201d he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was\\r\\nnot so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to\\r\\nfail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little\\r\\ncase-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow\\u2019s nest,\\r\\nwithin easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire\\r\\nand even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take\\r\\nit very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,\\r\\nseeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while\\r\\nwith mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics\\r\\naloft there in that bird\\u2019s nest within three or four perches of the\\r\\npole.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as\\r\\nCaptain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is\\r\\ngreatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those\\r\\nseductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used\\r\\nto lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a\\r\\nchat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;\\r\\nthen ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the\\r\\ntop-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so at\\r\\nlast mount to my ultimate destination.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept but\\r\\nsorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how\\r\\ncould I\\u2014being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering\\r\\naltitude\\u2014how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all\\r\\nwhale-ships\\u2019 standing orders, \\u201cKeep your weather eye open, and sing\\r\\nout every time.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of\\r\\nNantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with\\r\\nlean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who\\r\\noffers to ship with the Phaedon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware\\r\\nof such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be\\r\\nkilled; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes\\r\\nround the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor\\r\\nare these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery\\r\\nfurnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded\\r\\nyoung men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking\\r\\nsentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches\\r\\nhimself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship, and\\r\\nin moody phrase ejaculates:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cRoll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand\\r\\nblubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nVery often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded\\r\\nyoung philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient\\r\\n\\u201cinterest\\u201d in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly\\r\\nlost to all honourable ambition, as that in their secret souls they\\r\\nwould rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those\\r\\nyoung Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are\\r\\nshort-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have\\r\\nleft their opera-glasses at home.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, thou monkey,\\u201d said a harpooneer to one of these lads,\\r\\n\\u201cwe\\u2019ve been cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not\\r\\nraised a whale yet. Whales are scarce as hen\\u2019s teeth whenever thou art\\r\\nup here.\\u201d Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been\\r\\nshoals of them in the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like\\r\\nlistlessness of vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth\\r\\nby the blending cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses\\r\\nhis identity; takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image\\r\\nof that deep, blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and\\r\\nevery strange, half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him;\\r\\nevery dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems\\r\\nto him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the\\r\\nsoul by continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy\\r\\nspirit ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and\\r\\nspace; like Crammer\\u2019s (Thomas Cranmer) sprinkled Pantheistic ashes,\\r\\nforming at last a part of every shore the round globe over.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a\\r\\ngently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from\\r\\nthe inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on ye,\\r\\nmove your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your identity\\r\\ncomes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And perhaps,\\r\\nat mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled shriek you\\r\\ndrop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no more to rise\\r\\nfor ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Enter Ahab: Then, all)\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one\\r\\nmorning shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the\\r\\ncabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that\\r\\nhour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in the\\r\\ngarden.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old\\r\\nrounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over\\r\\ndented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did\\r\\nyou fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,\\r\\nyou would see still stranger foot-prints\\u2014the foot-prints of his one\\r\\nunsleeping, ever-pacing thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as\\r\\nhis nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his\\r\\nthought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the\\r\\nmain-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought\\r\\nturn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely\\r\\npossessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of every\\r\\nouter movement.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cD\\u2019ye mark him, Flask?\\u201d whispered Stubb; \\u201cthe chick that\\u2019s in\\r\\nhim pecks the shell. \\u2018Twill soon be out.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hours wore on;\\u2014Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the\\r\\ndeck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the\\r\\nbulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and with\\r\\none hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody aft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSir!\\u201d said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given\\r\\non ship-board except in some extraordinary case.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSend everybody aft,\\u201d repeated Ahab. \\u201cMast-heads, there! come\\r\\ndown!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the entire ship\\u2019s company were assembled, and with curious and\\r\\nnot wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not\\r\\nunlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after\\r\\nrapidly glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the\\r\\ncrew, started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were\\r\\nnigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and\\r\\nhalf-slouched hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering\\r\\nwhispering among the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask,\\r\\nthat Ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing\\r\\na pedestrian feat. But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he\\r\\ncried:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat do ye do when ye see a whale, men?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSing out for him!\\u201d was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of\\r\\nclubbed voices.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood!\\u201d cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the\\r\\nhearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically\\r\\nthrown them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd what do ye next, men?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLower away, and after him!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd what tune is it ye pull to, men?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA dead whale or a stove boat!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nMore and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the\\r\\ncountenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began\\r\\nto gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they\\r\\nthemselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his\\r\\npivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly, almost\\r\\nconvulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about\\r\\na white whale. Look ye! d\\u2019ye see this Spanish ounce of\\r\\ngold?\\u201d\\u2014holding up a broad bright coin to the sun\\u2014\\u201cit is a\\r\\nsixteen dollar piece, men. D\\u2019ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon\\r\\ntop-maul.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was\\r\\nslowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if\\r\\nto heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile\\r\\nlowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and\\r\\ninarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his\\r\\nvitality in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast\\r\\nwith the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the\\r\\nother, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \\u201cWhosoever of ye\\r\\nraises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;\\r\\nwhosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes\\r\\npunctured in his starboard fluke\\u2014look ye, whosoever of ye raises me\\r\\nthat same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHuzza! huzza!\\u201d cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they\\r\\nhailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a white whale, I say,\\u201d resumed Ahab, as he threw down the\\r\\ntopmaul: \\u201ca white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for\\r\\nwhite water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even\\r\\nmore intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention\\r\\nof the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was\\r\\nseparately touched by some specific recollection.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Ahab,\\u201d said Tashtego, \\u201cthat white whale must be the same\\r\\nthat some call Moby Dick.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMoby Dick?\\u201d shouted Ahab. \\u201cDo ye know the white whale then,\\r\\nTash?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDoes he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\\u201d said\\r\\nthe Gay-Header deliberately.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd has he a curious spout, too,\\u201d said Daggoo, \\u201cvery bushy, even\\r\\nfor a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd he have one, two, three\\u2014oh! good many iron in him hide, too,\\r\\nCaptain,\\u201d cried Queequeg disjointedly, \\u201call twiske-tee be-twisk,\\r\\nlike him\\u2014him\\u2014\\u201d faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand\\r\\nround and round as though uncorking a bottle\\u2014\\u201clike him\\u2014him\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCorkscrew!\\u201d cried Ahab, \\u201caye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all\\r\\ntwisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like\\r\\na whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after\\r\\nthe great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like\\r\\na split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have\\r\\nseen\\u2014Moby Dick\\u2014Moby Dick!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Ahab,\\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus\\r\\nfar been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last\\r\\nseemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder.\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick\\u2014but it was not Moby Dick\\r\\nthat took off thy leg?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho told thee that?\\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \\u201cAye, Starbuck;\\r\\naye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby\\r\\nDick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\\u201d he\\r\\nshouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken\\r\\nmoose; \\u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made\\r\\na poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\\u201d Then tossing both\\r\\narms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: \\u201cAye, aye! and\\r\\nI\\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the\\r\\nNorway Maelstrom, and round perdition\\u2019s flames before I give him up.\\r\\nAnd this is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on\\r\\nboth sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black\\r\\nblood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it,\\r\\nnow? I think ye do look brave.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye!\\u201d shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to\\r\\nthe excited old man: \\u201cA sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance\\r\\nfor Moby Dick!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGod bless ye,\\u201d he seemed to half sob and half shout. \\u201cGod bless\\r\\nye, men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what\\u2019s this\\r\\nlong face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art\\r\\nnot game for Moby Dick?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain\\r\\nAhab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but\\r\\nI came here to hunt whales, not my commander\\u2019s vengeance. How many\\r\\nbarrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain\\r\\nAhab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest\\r\\na little lower layer. If money\\u2019s to be the measurer, man, and the\\r\\naccountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by\\r\\ngirdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then, let\\r\\nme tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe smites his chest,\\u201d whispered Stubb, \\u201cwhat\\u2019s that for?\\r\\nmethinks it rings most vast, but hollow.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVengeance on a dumb brute!\\u201d cried Starbuck, \\u201cthat simply smote\\r\\nthee from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab, seems blasphemous.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHark ye yet again\\u2014the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,\\r\\nare but as pasteboard masks. But in each event\\u2014in the living act,\\r\\nthe undoubted deed\\u2014there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts\\r\\nforth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask.\\r\\nIf man will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach\\r\\noutside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is\\r\\nthat wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there\\u2019s naught beyond.\\r\\nBut \\u2018tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous\\r\\nstrength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable thing\\r\\nis chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the white\\r\\nwhale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me of\\r\\nblasphemy, man; I\\u2019d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the\\r\\nsun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of\\r\\nfair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my\\r\\nmaster, man, is even that fair play. Who\\u2019s over me? Truth hath no\\r\\nconfines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends\\u2019 glarings\\r\\nis a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has\\r\\nmelted thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat,\\r\\nthat thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small\\r\\nindignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder\\r\\nTurkish cheeks of spotted tawn\\u2014living, breathing pictures painted by\\r\\nthe sun. The Pagan leopards\\u2014the unrecking and unworshipping things,\\r\\nthat live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!\\r\\nThe crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this\\r\\nmatter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he\\r\\nsnorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one tost\\r\\nsapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. \\u2018Tis but to help\\r\\nstrike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From this\\r\\none poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely he will\\r\\nnot hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a whetstone? Ah!\\r\\nconstrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee! Speak, but\\r\\nspeak!\\u2014Aye, aye! thy silence, then, that voices thee. (Aside)\\r\\nSomething shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in his lungs.\\r\\nStarbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without rebellion.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGod keep me!\\u2014keep us all!\\u201d murmured Starbuck, lowly.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab\\r\\ndid not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the\\r\\nhold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage;\\r\\nnor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment\\r\\ntheir hearts sank in. For again Starbuck\\u2019s downcast eyes lighted up\\r\\nwith the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the\\r\\nwinds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as\\r\\nbefore. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?\\r\\nBut rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so\\r\\nmuch predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing\\r\\nthings within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost\\r\\nnecessities in our being, these still drive us on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe measure! the measure!\\u201d cried Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nReceiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he\\r\\nordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him near\\r\\nthe capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three mates\\r\\nstood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship\\u2019s\\r\\ncompany formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant\\r\\nsearchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met\\r\\nhis, as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their\\r\\nleader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,\\r\\nalas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDrink and pass!\\u201d he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the\\r\\nnearest seaman. \\u201cThe crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short\\r\\ndraughts\\u2014long swallows, men; \\u2018tis hot as Satan\\u2019s hoof. So, so;\\r\\nit goes round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the\\r\\nserpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this\\r\\nway it comes. Hand it me\\u2014here\\u2019s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so\\r\\nbrimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAttend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan;\\r\\nand ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there\\r\\nwith your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some\\r\\nsort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,\\r\\nyou will yet see that\\u2014Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.\\r\\nHand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, were\\u2019t not\\r\\nthou St. Vitus\\u2019 imp\\u2014away, thou ague!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAdvance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let\\r\\nme touch the axis.\\u201d So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the\\r\\nthree level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,\\r\\nsuddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from\\r\\nStarbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some\\r\\nnameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the\\r\\nsame fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own magnetic\\r\\nlife. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained, and mystic\\r\\naspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest eye of\\r\\nStarbuck fell downright.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIn vain!\\u201d cried Ahab; \\u201cbut, maybe, \\u2018tis well. For did ye three\\r\\nbut once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, that\\r\\nhad perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped\\r\\nye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do\\r\\nappoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there\\u2014yon three\\r\\nmost honourable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain\\r\\nthe task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using\\r\\nhis tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension, that\\r\\nshall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your seizings\\r\\nand draw the poles, ye harpooneers!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSilently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the\\r\\ndetached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs\\r\\nup, before him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know\\r\\nye not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,\\r\\nadvance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!\\u201d Forthwith,\\r\\nslowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon\\r\\nsockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow\\r\\nthem, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!\\r\\nStarbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon\\r\\nit. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the deathful\\r\\nwhaleboat\\u2019s bow\\u2014Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do not\\r\\nhunt Moby Dick to his death!\\u201d The long, barbed steel goblets were\\r\\nlifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the\\r\\nspirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled,\\r\\nand turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished pewter\\r\\nwent the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free hand to\\r\\nthem, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 37. Sunset.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out.\\r\\n\\r\\nI leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where\\u2019er\\r\\nI sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;\\r\\nbut first I pass.\\r\\n\\r\\nYonder, by ever-brimming goblet\\u2019s rim, the warm waves blush like\\r\\nwine. The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun\\u2014slow dived from\\r\\nnoon\\u2014goes down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill.\\r\\nIs, then, the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy.\\r\\nYet is it bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far\\r\\nflashings; but darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds.\\r\\n\\u2018Tis iron\\u2014that I know\\u2014not gold. \\u2018Tis split, too\\u2014that I feel;\\r\\nthe jagged edge galls me so, my brain seems to beat against the solid\\r\\nmetal; aye, steel skull, mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most\\r\\nbrain-battering fight!\\r\\n\\r\\nDry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred\\r\\nme, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not me;\\r\\nall loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne\\u2019er enjoy. Gifted with\\r\\nthe high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most subtly\\r\\nand most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good night\\u2014good\\r\\nnight! (waving his hand, he moves from the window.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the\\r\\nleast; but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and\\r\\nthey revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they\\r\\nall stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others,\\r\\nthe match itself must needs be wasting! What I\\u2019ve dared, I\\u2019ve\\r\\nwilled; and what I\\u2019ve willed, I\\u2019ll do! They think me mad\\u2014Starbuck\\r\\ndoes; but I\\u2019m demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness\\r\\nthat\\u2019s only calm to comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should\\r\\nbe dismembered; and\\u2014Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will\\r\\ndismember my dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller\\r\\none. That\\u2019s more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot\\r\\nat ye, ye cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded\\r\\nBendigoes! I will not say as schoolboys do to bullies\\u2014Take some one of\\r\\nyour own size; don\\u2019t pommel me! No, ye\\u2019ve knocked me down, and I am\\r\\nup again; but ye have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton\\r\\nbags! I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab\\u2019s compliments to ye;\\r\\ncome and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else\\r\\nye swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed\\r\\npurpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.\\r\\nOver unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under\\r\\ntorrents\\u2019 beds, unerringly I rush! Naught\\u2019s an obstacle, naught\\u2019s\\r\\nan angle to the iron way!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 38. Dusk.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy soul is more than matched; she\\u2019s overmanned; and by a madman!\\r\\nInsufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But\\r\\nhe drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I see\\r\\nhis impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill I,\\r\\nthe ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have no\\r\\nknife to cut. Horrible old man! Who\\u2019s over him, he cries;\\u2014aye, he\\r\\nwould be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below!\\r\\nOh! I plainly see my miserable office,\\u2014to obey, rebelling; and worse\\r\\nyet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe\\r\\nwould shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow\\r\\nwide. The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the\\r\\nsmall gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God\\r\\nmay wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole\\r\\nclock\\u2019s run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key\\r\\nto lift again.\\r\\n\\r\\n[A burst of revelry from the forecastle.]\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of human\\r\\nmothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white whale\\r\\nis their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is forward!\\r\\nmark the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life. Foremost\\r\\nthrough the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled, bantering\\r\\nbow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods within his\\r\\nsternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake, and further\\r\\non, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills me through!\\r\\nPeace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! \\u2018tis in an hour like\\r\\nthis, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,\\u2014as wild, untutored\\r\\nthings are forced to feed\\u2014Oh, life! \\u2018tis now that I do feel the\\r\\nlatent horror in thee! but \\u2018tis not me! that horror\\u2019s out of me! and\\r\\nwith the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight ye,\\r\\nye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye blessed\\r\\ninfluences!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 39. First Night Watch. Fore-Top.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Stubb solus, and mending a brace.)\\r\\n\\r\\nHa! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!\\u2014I\\u2019ve been thinking over it\\r\\never since, and that ha, ha\\u2019s the final consequence. Why so? Because\\r\\na laugh\\u2019s the wisest, easiest answer to all that\\u2019s queer; and come\\r\\nwhat will, one comfort\\u2019s always left\\u2014that unfailing comfort is,\\r\\nit\\u2019s all predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to\\r\\nmy poor eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt.\\r\\nBe sure the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had\\r\\nthe gift, might readily have prophesied it\\u2014for when I clapped my\\r\\neye upon his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, wise Stubb\\u2014that\\u2019s my\\r\\ntitle\\u2014well, Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here\\u2019s a carcase. I know\\r\\nnot all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I\\u2019ll go to it\\r\\nlaughing. Such a waggish leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel\\r\\nfunny. Fa, la! lirra, skirra! What\\u2019s my juicy little pear at home\\r\\ndoing now? Crying its eyes out?\\u2014Giving a party to the last arrived\\r\\nharpooneers, I dare say, gay as a frigate\\u2019s pennant, and so am I\\u2014fa,\\r\\nla! lirra, skirra! Oh\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\u2019ll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and\\r\\nfleeting As bubbles that swim, on the beaker\\u2019s brim, And break on the\\r\\nlips while meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nA brave stave that\\u2014who calls?

HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning, and\\r\\nlying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus.)\\r\\n\\r\\n     Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies!\\r\\n     Farewell and adieu to you, ladies of Spain!\\r\\n     Our captain\\u2019s commanded.\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don\\u2019t be sentimental; it\\u2019s bad for\\r\\nthe digestion! Take a tonic, follow me! (Sings, and all follow)\\r\\n\\r\\n    Our captain stood upon the deck,\\r\\n    A spy-glass in his hand,\\r\\n    A viewing of those gallant whales\\r\\n    That blew at every strand.\\r\\n    Oh, your tubs in your boats, my boys,\\r\\n    And by your braces stand,\\r\\n    And we\\u2019ll have one of those fine whales,\\r\\n    Hand, boys, over hand!\\r\\n    So, be cheery, my lads! may your hearts never fail!\\r\\n    While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!\\r\\n\\r\\nMATE\\u2019S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!\\r\\n\\r\\n2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d\\u2019ye hear,\\r\\nbell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me\\r\\ncall the watch.

Tumble up!\\r\\n\\r\\nDUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark\\r\\nthis in our old Mogul\\u2019s wine; it\\u2019s quite as deadening to some as\\r\\nfilliping to others. We sing; they sleep\\u2014aye, lie down there, like\\r\\nground-tier butts. At \\u2018em again! There, take this copper-pump, and\\r\\nhail \\u2018em through it. Tell \\u2018em to avast dreaming of their lasses.\\r\\nTell \\u2018em it\\u2019s the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come\\r\\nto judgment. That\\u2019s the way\\u2014that\\u2019s it; thy throat ain\\u2019t spoiled\\r\\nwith eating Amsterdam butter.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let\\u2019s have a jig or two before we ride to\\r\\nanchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand\\r\\nby all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!\\r\\n\\r\\nPIP. (Sulky and sleepy) Don\\u2019t know where it is.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I\\r\\nsay; merry\\u2019s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won\\u2019t you dance? Form, now,\\r\\nIndian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves! Legs!\\r\\nlegs!\\r\\n\\r\\nICELAND SAILOR. I don\\u2019t like your floor, maty; it\\u2019s too springy to\\r\\nmy taste. I\\u2019m used to ice-floors. I\\u2019m sorry to throw cold water on\\r\\nthe subject; but excuse me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where\\u2019s your girls? Who but a fool would take\\r\\nhis left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d\\u2019ye do? Partners!\\r\\nI must have partners!\\r\\n\\r\\nSICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!\\u2014then I\\u2019ll hop with ye; yea,\\r\\nturn grasshopper!\\r\\n\\r\\nLONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there\\u2019s plenty more of\\r\\nus.

(Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the scuttle.)\\r\\nHere you are, Pip; and there\\u2019s the windlass-bitts; up you mount! Now,\\r\\nboys! (The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go below; some\\r\\nsleep or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAZORE SAILOR. (Dancing) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig it,\\r\\nstig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!\\r\\n\\r\\nPIP. Jinglers, you say?\\u2014there goes another, dropped off; I pound it\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\r\\nCHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of\\r\\nthyself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through it!\\r\\nSplit jibs! tear yourselves!\\r\\n\\r\\nTASHTEGO. (Quietly smoking) That\\u2019s a white man; he calls that fun:\\r\\nhumph! I save my sweat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what\\r\\nthey are dancing over. I\\u2019ll dance over your grave, I will\\u2014that\\u2019s\\r\\nthe bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round\\r\\ncorners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled\\r\\ncrews! Well, well; belike the whole world\\u2019s a ball, as you scholars\\r\\nhave it; and so \\u2018tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads,\\r\\nyou\\u2019re young; I was once.\\r\\n\\r\\n3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!\\u2014whew! this is worse than pulling after\\r\\nwhales in a calm\\u2014give us a whiff, Tash.\\r\\n\\r\\n(They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky\\r\\ndarkens\\u2014the wind rises.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it\\u2019ll be douse sail soon. The\\r\\nsky-born, high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow,\\r\\nSeeva!\\r\\n\\r\\nMALTESE SAILOR. (Reclining and shaking his cap.) It\\u2019s the waves\\u2014the\\r\\nsnow\\u2019s caps turn to jig it now. They\\u2019ll shake their tassels soon.\\r\\nNow would all the waves were women, then I\\u2019d go drown, and chassee\\r\\nwith them evermore! There\\u2019s naught so sweet on earth\\u2014heaven may not\\r\\nmatch it!\\u2014as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance,\\r\\nwhen the over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSICILIAN SAILOR.

I\\r\\nstill rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven\\r\\nin the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn\\r\\nand wilted quite. Ah me!\\u2014not thou nor I can bear the change! How\\r\\nthen, if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from\\r\\nPirohitee\\u2019s peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown\\r\\nthe villages?\\u2014The blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (Leaps to\\r\\nhis feet.)\\r\\n\\r\\nPORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing \\u2018gainst the side! Stand\\r\\nby for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell\\r\\nthey\\u2019ll go lunging presently.\\r\\n\\r\\nDANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou\\r\\nholdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He\\u2019s no\\r\\nmore afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the\\r\\nBaltic with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!\\r\\n\\r\\n4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR.

Pines are the hardest sort\\r\\nof tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there\\u2019s none\\r\\nbut the crew\\u2019s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady.

Moby Dick.\\r\\n\\r\\nI, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;\\r\\nmy oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more\\r\\ndid I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A\\r\\nwild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab\\u2019s quenchless\\r\\nfeud seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that\\r\\nmurderous monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths\\r\\nof violence and revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,\\r\\nsecluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly\\r\\nfrequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his\\r\\nexistence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him;\\r\\nwhile the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to\\r\\nhim, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers;\\r\\nthe disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery\\r\\ncircumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along\\r\\nsolitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or\\r\\nmore on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort;\\r\\nthe inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the\\r\\ntimes of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct\\r\\nand indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide\\r\\nwhaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby\\r\\nDick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have\\r\\nencountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian,\\r\\na Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after\\r\\ndoing great mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to\\r\\nsome minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in\\r\\nquestion must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the\\r\\nSperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent\\r\\ninstances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster\\r\\nattacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave\\r\\nbattle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were\\r\\ncontent to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to\\r\\nthe perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual\\r\\ncause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and\\r\\nthe whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance\\r\\ncaught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one of\\r\\nthem, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any other\\r\\nwhale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue in these\\r\\nassaults\\u2014not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken limbs,\\r\\nor devouring amputations\\u2014but fatal to the last degree of fatality;\\r\\nthose repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and piling their\\r\\nterrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake the fortitude\\r\\nof many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White Whale had\\r\\neventually come.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more\\r\\nhorrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do\\r\\nfabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising\\r\\nterrible events,\\u2014as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in\\r\\nmaritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors abound,\\r\\nwherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to. And as the\\r\\nsea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery surpasses\\r\\nevery other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and fearfulness\\r\\nof the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only are whalemen\\r\\nas a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary\\r\\nto all sailors; but of all sailors, they are by all odds the most\\r\\ndirectly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing\\r\\nin the sea; face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels, but,\\r\\nhand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such remotest waters, that\\r\\nthough you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a thousand shores, you\\r\\nwould not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or aught hospitable beneath\\r\\nthat part of the sun; in such latitudes and longitudes, pursuing too\\r\\nsuch a calling as he does, the whaleman is wrapped by influences all\\r\\ntending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over\\r\\nthe widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did\\r\\nin the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints,\\r\\nand half-formed foetal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which\\r\\neventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything\\r\\nthat visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally\\r\\nstrike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White\\r\\nWhale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his\\r\\njaw.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.\\r\\nNot even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm\\r\\nWhale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the\\r\\nleviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are\\r\\nthose this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous\\r\\nenough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would\\r\\nperhaps\\u2014either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or\\r\\ntimidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there are\\r\\nplenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not sailing\\r\\nunder the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered the Sperm\\r\\nWhale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to\\r\\nthe ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North; seated on their\\r\\nhatches, these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest\\r\\nand awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern whaling. Nor is the\\r\\npre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale anywhere more\\r\\nfeelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows which stem him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as if the now tested reality of his might had in former\\r\\nlegendary times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book\\r\\nnaturalists\\u2014Olassen and Povelson\\u2014declaring the Sperm Whale not only\\r\\nto be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to\\r\\nbe so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.\\r\\nNor even down to so late a time as Cuvier\\u2019s, were these or almost\\r\\nsimilar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron\\r\\nhimself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks\\r\\nincluded) are \\u201cstruck with the most lively terrors,\\u201d and \\u201coften in\\r\\nthe precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks\\r\\nwith such violence as to cause instantaneous death.\\u201d And however the\\r\\ngeneral experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet\\r\\nin their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson,\\r\\nthe superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their\\r\\nvocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few of\\r\\nthe fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days\\r\\nof the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long\\r\\npractised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring\\r\\nwarfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be\\r\\nhopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition\\r\\nas the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would\\r\\nbe inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are\\r\\nsome remarkable documents that may be consulted.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things\\r\\nwere ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,\\r\\nchancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the\\r\\nspecific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious\\r\\naccompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if\\r\\noffered.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\\r\\nwith the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined,\\r\\nwas the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had\\r\\nactually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same\\r\\ninstant of time.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit altogether\\r\\nwithout some faint show of superstitious probability. For as the secrets\\r\\nof the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged, even to\\r\\nthe most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm Whale\\r\\nwhen beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to his\\r\\npursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious and\\r\\ncontradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning the\\r\\nmystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he transports\\r\\nhimself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\\r\\nas well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\\r\\nthat some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\\r\\nbodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland\\r\\nseas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has\\r\\nbeen declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could\\r\\nnot have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\\r\\nbelieved by some whalemen, that the Nor\\u2019 West Passage, so long a\\r\\nproblem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the\\r\\nreal living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times\\r\\nof the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there\\r\\nwas said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the\\r\\nsurface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain\\r\\nnear Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy\\r\\nLand by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost\\r\\nfully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.\\r\\n\\r\\nForced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing\\r\\nthat after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped\\r\\nalive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should\\r\\ngo still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only\\r\\nubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that\\r\\nthough groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still\\r\\nswim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick\\r\\nblood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in\\r\\nunensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied jet would\\r\\nonce more be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in\\r\\nthe earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike\\r\\nthe imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his\\r\\nuncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\\r\\nbut, as was elsewhere thrown out\\u2014a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\\r\\nforehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\\r\\nfeatures; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\\r\\nrevealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\\r\\nthe same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\\r\\nappellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\\r\\nhis vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\\r\\nsea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\\r\\ngleamings.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\\r\\ndeformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,\\r\\nas that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific\\r\\naccounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than\\r\\nall, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught\\r\\nelse. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every\\r\\napparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn\\r\\nround suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to\\r\\nsplinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\\r\\ndisasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in\\r\\nthe fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale\\u2019s\\r\\ninfernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\\r\\nthat he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\\r\\nunintelligent agent.\\r\\n\\r\\nJudge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\\r\\nhis more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\\r\\nboats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\\r\\nwhite curds of the whale\\u2019s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\\r\\nsunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\\r\\neddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\\r\\ndashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking\\r\\nwith a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale.\\r\\nThat captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his\\r\\nsickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab\\u2019s\\r\\nleg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no\\r\\nhired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice.\\r\\nSmall reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal\\r\\nencounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale,\\r\\nall the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came\\r\\nto identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his\\r\\nintellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before\\r\\nhim as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which\\r\\nsome deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with\\r\\nhalf a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been\\r\\nfrom the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\\r\\none-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced\\r\\nin their statue devil;\\u2014Ahab did not fall down and worship it like\\r\\nthem; but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale,\\r\\nhe pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All that most maddens and\\r\\ntorments; all that stirs up the lees of things; all truth with malice\\r\\nin it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle\\r\\ndemonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly\\r\\npersonified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon\\r\\nthe whale\\u2019s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt\\r\\nby his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a\\r\\nmortar, he burst his hot heart\\u2019s shell upon it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\\r\\nthe precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the\\r\\nmonster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\\r\\ncorporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\\r\\nprobably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\\r\\nYet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\\r\\nmonths of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one\\r\\nhammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape;\\r\\nthen it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another;\\r\\nand so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward\\r\\nvoyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems\\r\\nall but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage,\\r\\nhe was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital\\r\\nstrength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified\\r\\nby his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even\\r\\nthere, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung\\r\\nto the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable\\r\\nlatitudes, the ship, with mild stun\\u2019sails spread, floated across the\\r\\ntranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man\\u2019s delirium\\r\\nseemed left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from\\r\\nhis dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore\\r\\nthat firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders\\r\\nonce again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now\\r\\ngone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is\\r\\noftentimes a cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it\\r\\nmay have but become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab\\u2019s\\r\\nfull lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated\\r\\nHudson, when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably\\r\\nthrough the Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not\\r\\none jot of Ahab\\u2019s broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad\\r\\nmadness, not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That\\r\\nbefore living agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious\\r\\ntrope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and\\r\\ncarried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark;\\r\\nso that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did\\r\\nnow possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought\\r\\nto bear upon any one reasonable object.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is much; yet Ahab\\u2019s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\\r\\nBut vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\\r\\nfar down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\\r\\nwe here stand\\u2014however grand and wonderful, now quit it;\\u2014and take\\r\\nyour way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\\r\\nwhere far beneath the fantastic towers of man\\u2019s upper earth, his root\\r\\nof grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\\r\\nburied beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\\r\\nthrone, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\\r\\npatient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\\r\\nages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud,\\r\\nsad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled\\r\\nroyalties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\\r\\nare sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\\r\\nchange, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\\r\\ndissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\\r\\nwas only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\\r\\nNevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\\r\\nwith ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\\r\\notherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\\r\\nterrible casualty which had overtaken him.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\\r\\nascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which\\r\\nalways afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\\r\\npresent voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\\r\\nthat far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\\r\\naccount of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\\r\\nisle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he\\r\\nwas all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\\r\\nof rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\\r\\nscorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\\r\\nidea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart\\r\\nhis iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\\r\\nOr, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\\r\\nyet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\\r\\nhis underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,\\r\\nthat with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\\r\\nhim, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only\\r\\nand all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his\\r\\nold acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him\\r\\nthen, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the\\r\\nship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises, the\\r\\nprofit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an\\r\\naudacious, immitigable, and supernatural revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a\\r\\nJob\\u2019s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly\\r\\nmade up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals\\u2014morally\\r\\nenfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or\\r\\nright-mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference\\r\\nand recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a\\r\\ncrew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal\\r\\nfatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so\\r\\naboundingly responded to the old man\\u2019s ire\\u2014by what evil magic their\\r\\nsouls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the\\r\\nWhite Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came\\r\\nto be\\u2014what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious\\r\\nunderstandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have seemed\\r\\nthe gliding great demon of the seas of life,\\u2014all this to explain,\\r\\nwould be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean miner that\\r\\nworks in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever\\r\\nshifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the irresistible\\r\\narm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand still? For one,\\r\\nI gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place; but while\\r\\nyet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see naught in that brute\\r\\nbut the deadliest ill.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of The Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he\\r\\nwas to me, as yet remains unsaid.\\r\\n\\r\\nAside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which\\r\\ncould not but occasionally awaken in any man\\u2019s soul some alarm, there\\r\\nwas another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,\\r\\nwhich at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest; and\\r\\nyet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of\\r\\nputting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of the whale\\r\\nthat above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to explain myself\\r\\nhere; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I must, else all\\r\\nthese chapters might be naught.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty, as\\r\\nif imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles, japonicas,\\r\\nand pearls; and though various nations have in some way recognised a\\r\\ncertain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric, grand old\\r\\nkings of Pegu placing the title \\u201cLord of the White Elephants\\u201d above\\r\\nall their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern\\r\\nkings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal\\r\\nstandard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snow-white\\r\\ncharger; and the great Austrian Empire, Caesarian, heir to overlording\\r\\nRome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue; and though\\r\\nthis pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself, giving the\\r\\nwhite man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and though, besides,\\r\\nall this, whiteness has been even made significant of gladness, for\\r\\namong the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and though in other\\r\\nmortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is made the emblem of\\r\\nmany touching, noble things\\u2014the innocence of brides, the benignity of\\r\\nage; though among the Red Men of America the giving of the white belt\\r\\nof wampum was the deepest pledge of honour; though in many climes,\\r\\nwhiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of the Judge,\\r\\nand contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by\\r\\nmilk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most\\r\\naugust religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness\\r\\nand power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame being\\r\\nheld the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies, Great Jove\\r\\nhimself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and though to the\\r\\nnoble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred White Dog was\\r\\nby far the holiest festival of their theology, that spotless, faithful\\r\\ncreature being held the purest envoy they could send to the Great Spirit\\r\\nwith the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and though directly from\\r\\nthe Latin word for white, all Christian priests derive the name of\\r\\none part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic, worn beneath the\\r\\ncassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish faith, white is\\r\\nspecially employed in the celebration of the Passion of our Lord; though\\r\\nin the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to the redeemed, and\\r\\nthe four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white before the great-white\\r\\nthrone, and the Holy One that sitteth there white like wool; yet for all\\r\\nthese accumulated associations, with whatever is sweet, and honourable,\\r\\nand sublime, there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea\\r\\nof this hue, which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness\\r\\nwhich affrights in blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when\\r\\ndivorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object\\r\\nterrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.\\r\\nWitness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;\\r\\nwhat but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent\\r\\nhorrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an\\r\\nabhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific, to the dumb\\r\\ngloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged tiger in his\\r\\nheraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded bear or\\r\\nshark.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him\\r\\nwho would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not\\r\\nthe whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable\\r\\nhideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,\\r\\nit might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the\\r\\nirresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the\\r\\nfleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together\\r\\ntwo such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us\\r\\nwith so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;\\r\\nyet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified\\r\\nterror.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that\\r\\ncreature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the\\r\\nsame quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly\\r\\nhit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish\\r\\nmass for the dead begins with \\u201cRequiem eternam\\u201d (eternal rest),\\r\\nwhence Requiem denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral\\r\\nmusic. Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in\\r\\nthis shark, and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him\\r\\nRequin.\\r\\n\\r\\nBethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual\\r\\nwonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all\\r\\nimaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God\\u2019s great,\\r\\nunflattering laureate, Nature.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged\\r\\ngale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch\\r\\nbelow, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the\\r\\nmain hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and\\r\\nwith a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth\\r\\nits vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous\\r\\nflutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered\\r\\ncries, as some king\\u2019s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its\\r\\ninexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took\\r\\nhold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white\\r\\nthing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled\\r\\nwaters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of\\r\\ntowns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only\\r\\nhint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and\\r\\nturning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!\\r\\nnever had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious\\r\\nthing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\\r\\nlearned that goney was some seaman\\u2019s name for albatross. So that by\\r\\nno possibility could Coleridge\\u2019s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with\\r\\nthose mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon\\r\\nour deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to be\\r\\nan albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a little\\r\\nbrighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.\\r\\n\\r\\nI assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird\\r\\nchiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in this,\\r\\nthat by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses;\\r\\nand these I have frequently seen, but never with such emotions as when I\\r\\nbeheld the Antarctic fowl.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will\\r\\ntell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.\\r\\nAt last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern\\r\\ntally round its neck, with the ship\\u2019s time and place; and then letting\\r\\nit escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was\\r\\ntaken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,\\r\\nthe invoking, and adoring cherubim!\\r\\n\\r\\nMost famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of\\r\\nthe White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,\\r\\nlarge-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a\\r\\nthousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the\\r\\nelected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those\\r\\ndays were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At\\r\\ntheir flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which\\r\\nevery evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his\\r\\nmane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more\\r\\nresplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A\\r\\nmost imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western\\r\\nworld, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the\\r\\nglories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,\\r\\nbluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid\\r\\nhis aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly\\r\\nstreamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his\\r\\ncircumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White\\r\\nSteed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his\\r\\ncool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to the\\r\\nbravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe. Nor\\r\\ncan it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble\\r\\nhorse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so clothed him\\r\\nwith divineness; and that this divineness had that in it which, though\\r\\ncommanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that\\r\\naccessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and\\r\\nAlbatross.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks\\r\\nthe eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It\\r\\nis that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he\\r\\nbears. The Albino is as well made as other men\\u2014has no substantive\\r\\ndeformity\\u2014and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes\\r\\nhim more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be\\r\\nso?\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but\\r\\nnot the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces\\r\\nthis crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the\\r\\ngauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White\\r\\nSquall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice\\r\\nomitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of\\r\\nthat passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their\\r\\nfaction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the\\r\\nmarket-place!\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all\\r\\nmankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It\\r\\ncannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of\\r\\nthe dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering\\r\\nthere; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of\\r\\nconsternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And\\r\\nfrom that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud\\r\\nin which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail to\\r\\nthrow the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in\\r\\na milk-white fog\\u2014Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that\\r\\neven the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on\\r\\nhis pallid horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious\\r\\nthing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest\\r\\nidealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to\\r\\naccount for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then,\\r\\nby the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of\\r\\nwhiteness\\u2014though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped\\r\\nof all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,\\r\\nbut nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however\\r\\nmodified;\\u2014can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct\\r\\nus to the hidden cause we seek?\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,\\r\\nand without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And\\r\\nthough, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about\\r\\nto be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were\\r\\nentirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able to\\r\\nrecall them now.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely\\r\\nacquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare mention\\r\\nof Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary, speechless\\r\\nprocessions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded with\\r\\nnew-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of the\\r\\nMiddle American States, why does the passing mention of a White Friar or\\r\\na White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?\\r\\n\\r\\nOr what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and\\r\\nkings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White\\r\\nTower of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of\\r\\nan untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its\\r\\nneighbors\\u2014the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer\\r\\ntowers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar moods,\\r\\ncomes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of\\r\\nthat name, while the thought of Virginia\\u2019s Blue Ridge is full of a\\r\\nsoft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all latitudes\\r\\nand longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a spectralness\\r\\nover the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with mortal\\r\\nthoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves, followed by\\r\\nthe gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a wholly\\r\\nunsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in reading\\r\\nthe old fairy tales of Central Europe, does \\u201cthe tall pale man\\u201d of\\r\\nthe Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through\\r\\nthe green of the groves\\u2014why is this phantom more terrible than all the\\r\\nwhooping imps of the Blocksburg?\\r\\n\\r\\nNor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling\\r\\nearthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the\\r\\ntearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide\\r\\nfield of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop\\r\\n(like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of\\r\\nhouse-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;\\u2014it\\r\\nis not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,\\r\\nsaddest city thou can\\u2019st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and\\r\\nthere is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro,\\r\\nthis whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful\\r\\ngreenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid\\r\\npallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness\\r\\nis not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of\\r\\nobjects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught\\r\\nof terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost\\r\\nsolely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when exhibited under\\r\\nany form at all approaching to muteness or universality. What I mean\\r\\nby these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the\\r\\nfollowing examples.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if by\\r\\nnight he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels just\\r\\nenough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under precisely\\r\\nsimilar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to view his\\r\\nship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness\\u2014as if from\\r\\nencircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round\\r\\nhim, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded phantom\\r\\nof the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in vain the\\r\\nlead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm they both go\\r\\ndown; he never rests till blue water is under him again. Yet where is\\r\\nthe mariner who will tell thee, \\u201cSir, it was not so much the fear of\\r\\nstriking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so\\r\\nstirred me?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the\\r\\nsnowhowdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the\\r\\nmere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast\\r\\naltitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be\\r\\nto lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the\\r\\nbackwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an\\r\\nunbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig\\r\\nto break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding the\\r\\nscenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal trick\\r\\nof legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and half\\r\\nshipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery,\\r\\nviews what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean\\r\\nice monuments and splintered crosses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but\\r\\na white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo,\\r\\nIshmael.\\r\\n\\r\\nTell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of\\r\\nVermont, far removed from all beasts of prey\\u2014why is it that upon the\\r\\nsunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that\\r\\nhe cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness\\u2014why\\r\\nwill he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies\\r\\nof affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild\\r\\ncreatures in his green northern home, so that the strange muskiness he\\r\\nsmells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of\\r\\nformer perils; for what knows he, this New England colt, of the black\\r\\nbisons of distant Oregon?\\r\\n\\r\\nNo; but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the\\r\\nknowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from\\r\\nOregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring bison\\r\\nherds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies, which\\r\\nthis instant they may be trampling into dust.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings\\r\\nof the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the\\r\\nwindrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking\\r\\nof that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!\\r\\n\\r\\nThough neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic\\r\\nsign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere\\r\\nthose things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible\\r\\nworld seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in fright.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and\\r\\nlearned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange\\r\\nand far more portentous\\u2014why, as we have seen, it is at once the\\r\\nmost meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the\\r\\nChristian\\u2019s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent\\r\\nin things the most appalling to mankind.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids\\r\\nand immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the\\r\\nthought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky\\r\\nway? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as\\r\\nthe visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all\\r\\ncolours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,\\r\\nfull of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows\\u2014a colourless, all-colour\\r\\nof atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory\\r\\nof the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues\\u2014every stately\\r\\nor lovely emblazoning\\u2014the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,\\r\\nand the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of\\r\\nyoung girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent\\r\\nin substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified Nature\\r\\nabsolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover nothing but\\r\\nthe charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and consider that\\r\\nthe mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues, the great\\r\\nprinciple of light, for ever remains white or colourless in itself, and\\r\\nif operating without medium upon matter, would touch all objects, even\\r\\ntulips and roses, with its own blank tinge\\u2014pondering all this, the\\r\\npalsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful travellers in\\r\\nLapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their\\r\\neyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental\\r\\nwhite shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And of all these\\r\\nthings the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at the fiery\\r\\nhunt?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 43. Hark!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the middle-watch; a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in a\\r\\ncordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to the\\r\\nscuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the buckets\\r\\nto fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the hallowed\\r\\nprecincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak or rustle\\r\\ntheir feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the deepest silence,\\r\\nonly broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the steady hum of the\\r\\nunceasingly advancing keel.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon, whose\\r\\npost was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a Cholo, the\\r\\nwords above.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTake the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d\\u2019ye mean?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere it is again\\u2014under the hatches\\u2014don\\u2019t you hear it\\u2014a\\r\\ncough\\u2014it sounded like a cough.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere again\\u2014there it is!\\u2014it sounds like two or three sleepers\\r\\nturning over, now!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It\\u2019s the three soaked\\r\\nbiscuits ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye\\u2014nothing else.\\r\\nLook to the bucket!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSay what ye will, shipmate; I\\u2019ve sharp ears.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, you are the chap, ain\\u2019t ye, that heard the hum of the old\\r\\nQuakeress\\u2019s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket;\\r\\nyou\\u2019re the chap.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGrin away; we\\u2019ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is\\r\\nsomebody down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and\\r\\nI suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell\\r\\nFlask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the\\r\\nwind.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTish! the bucket!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 44. The Chart.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that\\r\\ntook place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose\\r\\nwith his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom,\\r\\nand bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts, spread\\r\\nthem before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating himself before\\r\\nit, you would have seen him intently study the various lines and\\r\\nshadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady pencil trace\\r\\nadditional courses over spaces that before were blank. At intervals, he\\r\\nwould refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein were set down\\r\\nthe seasons and places in which, on various former voyages of various\\r\\nships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his\\r\\nhead, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever threw\\r\\nshifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till it\\r\\nalmost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses\\r\\non the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and\\r\\ncourses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his\\r\\ncabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were\\r\\nbrought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and\\r\\nothers were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before\\r\\nhim, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to\\r\\nthe more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,\\r\\nit might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary\\r\\ncreature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it\\r\\nseem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby\\r\\ncalculating the driftings of the sperm whale\\u2019s food; and, also,\\r\\ncalling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in\\r\\nparticular latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost\\r\\napproaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this\\r\\nor that ground in search of his prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the\\r\\nsperm whale\\u2019s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe\\r\\nthat, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;\\r\\nwere the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully\\r\\ncollated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to\\r\\ncorrespond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the\\r\\nflights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct\\r\\nelaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*\\r\\n\\r\\n     *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne\\r\\n     out by an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of\\r\\n     the National Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By\\r\\n     that circular, it appears that precisely such a chart is in\\r\\n     course of completion; and portions of it are presented in\\r\\n     the circular. \\u201cThis chart divides the ocean into districts\\r\\n     of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude;\\r\\n     perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve\\r\\n     columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each\\r\\n     of which districts are three lines; one to show the number\\r\\n     of days that have been spent in each month in every\\r\\n     district, and the two others to show the number of days in\\r\\n     which whales, sperm or right, have been seen.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the\\r\\nsperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct\\u2014say, rather, secret\\r\\nintelligence from the Deity\\u2014mostly swim in veins, as they are called;\\r\\ncontinuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating\\r\\nexactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with\\r\\none tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the\\r\\ndirection taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor\\u2019s\\r\\nparallel, and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its\\r\\nown unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary vein in which at these\\r\\ntimes he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width\\r\\n(more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but\\r\\nnever exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship\\u2019s mast-heads,\\r\\nwhen circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at\\r\\nparticular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating\\r\\nwhales may with great confidence be looked for.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate\\r\\nfeeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing\\r\\nthe widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his\\r\\nart, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be wholly\\r\\nwithout prospect of a meeting.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his\\r\\ndelirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,\\r\\nperhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons\\r\\nfor particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the\\r\\nherds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,\\r\\nsay, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found\\r\\nthere the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable\\r\\ninstances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the\\r\\nsame remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries\\r\\nand hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby\\r\\nDick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the\\r\\nSeychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese\\r\\nCoast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of\\r\\nthose spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly\\r\\nencounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding grounds, where\\r\\nhe had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed only his casual\\r\\nstopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his places of prolonged\\r\\nabode. And where Ahab\\u2019s chances of accomplishing his object have\\r\\nhitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to whatever\\r\\nway-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a particular\\r\\nset time or place were attained, when all possibilities would become\\r\\nprobabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the next\\r\\nthing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were conjoined\\r\\nin the one technical phrase\\u2014the Season-on-the-Line. For there and\\r\\nthen, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been periodically\\r\\ndescried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun, in its\\r\\nannual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the\\r\\nZodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with\\r\\nthe white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his\\r\\ndeeds; there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man\\r\\nhad found the awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious\\r\\ncomprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his\\r\\nbrooding soul into this unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to\\r\\nrest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned, however\\r\\nflattering it might be to those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of\\r\\nhis vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all\\r\\nintervening quest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the\\r\\nSeason-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her commander\\r\\nto make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and then running\\r\\ndown sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial Pacific in time\\r\\nto cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next ensuing season.\\r\\nYet the premature hour of the Pequod\\u2019s sailing had, perhaps, been\\r\\ncorrectly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of\\r\\nthings. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days\\r\\nand nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently\\r\\nenduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance\\r\\nthe White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his\\r\\nperiodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the\\r\\nPersian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other\\r\\nwaters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor\\u2019-Westers,\\r\\nHarmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon, might blow\\r\\nMoby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\ncircumnavigating wake.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not\\r\\nbut a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary\\r\\nwhale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual\\r\\nrecognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the\\r\\nthronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar\\r\\nsnow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but\\r\\nbe unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter\\r\\nto himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\\r\\nwould throw himself back in reveries\\u2014tallied him, and shall he escape?\\r\\nHis broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep\\u2019s\\r\\near! And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a\\r\\nweariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air\\r\\nof the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances\\r\\nof torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved\\r\\nrevengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own\\r\\nbloody nails in his palms.\\r\\n\\r\\nOften, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\\r\\ndreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through\\r\\nthe day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them\\r\\nround and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing\\r\\nof his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes\\r\\nthe case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its\\r\\nbase, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and\\r\\nlightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among\\r\\nthem; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be\\r\\nheard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his\\r\\nstate room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these,\\r\\nperhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent\\r\\nweakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens\\r\\nof its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming,\\r\\nunappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had\\r\\ngone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from\\r\\nit in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or\\r\\nsoul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the\\r\\ncharacterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer\\r\\nvehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching\\r\\ncontiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no\\r\\nlonger an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with\\r\\nthe soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab\\u2019s case, yielding\\r\\nup all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that\\r\\npurpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods\\r\\nand devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own.\\r\\nNay, could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it\\r\\nwas conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered\\r\\nbirth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes,\\r\\nwhen what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a\\r\\nvacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light,\\r\\nto be sure, but without an object to colour, and therefore a blankness\\r\\nin itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature\\r\\nin thee; and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a\\r\\nvulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that vulture the very creature\\r\\nhe creates.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed, as\\r\\nindirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars\\r\\nin the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in its earlier\\r\\npart, is as important a one as will be found in this volume; but the\\r\\nleading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly\\r\\nenlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood, and moreover to\\r\\ntake away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire\\r\\nsubject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity of the main\\r\\npoints of this affair.\\r\\n\\r\\nI care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall\\r\\nbe content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of\\r\\nitems, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from these\\r\\ncitations, I take it\\u2014the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of\\r\\nitself.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\\r\\nreceiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\\r\\ninterval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by\\r\\nthe same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\\r\\nprivate cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where\\r\\nthree years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I\\r\\nthink it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\\r\\nthem happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\\r\\nAfrica, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far\\r\\ninto the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,\\r\\noften endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas,\\r\\nwith all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\\r\\nunknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have\\r\\nbeen on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\\r\\nbrushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\\r\\nThis man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\\r\\nother. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that\\r\\nis in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack,\\r\\nsaw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards\\r\\ntaken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out\\r\\nthat I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time\\r\\ndistinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale\\u2019s\\r\\neye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years,\\r\\nbut I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances,\\r\\nthen, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many\\r\\nother instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no\\r\\ngood ground to impeach.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\\r\\nthe world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\\r\\nhistorical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\\r\\ndistant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\\r\\nthus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\\r\\npeculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar\\r\\nin that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\\r\\npeculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\\r\\nvaluable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\\r\\nof the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\\r\\nsuch a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that\\r\\nmost fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\\r\\ntarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\\r\\nwithout seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some\\r\\npoor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they\\r\\nmake distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they\\r\\npursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump for\\r\\ntheir presumption.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual\\r\\ncelebrity\\u2014Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he\\r\\nfamous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,\\r\\nbut he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions of\\r\\na name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Caesar. Was it not so,\\r\\nO Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so long\\r\\ndid\\u2019st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was oft\\r\\nseen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand Jack!\\r\\nthou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of\\r\\nthe Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan, whose lofty\\r\\njet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white cross\\r\\nagainst the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale, marked\\r\\nlike an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In plain\\r\\nprose, here are four whales as well known to the students of Cetacean\\r\\nHistory as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various\\r\\ntimes creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were\\r\\nfinally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed\\r\\nby valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with\\r\\nthat express object as much in view, as in setting out through the\\r\\nNarragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture\\r\\nthat notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the\\r\\nIndian King Philip.\\r\\n\\r\\nI do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make\\r\\nmention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in\\r\\nprinted form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the\\r\\nwhole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For\\r\\nthis is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full\\r\\nas much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of\\r\\nthe plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without\\r\\nsome hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the\\r\\nfishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still\\r\\nworse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general\\r\\nperils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid\\r\\nconception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.\\r\\nOne reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and\\r\\ndeaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,\\r\\nhowever transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose\\r\\nthat that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by the\\r\\nwhale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to the\\r\\nbottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan\\u2014do you suppose that that\\r\\npoor fellow\\u2019s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read\\r\\nto-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular\\r\\nbetween here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be\\r\\ncalled regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you\\r\\nthat upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many\\r\\nothers we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a\\r\\ndeath by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each\\r\\nlost a boat\\u2019s crew. For God\\u2019s sake, be economical with your lamps\\r\\nand candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man\\u2019s\\r\\nblood was spilled for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is\\r\\nan enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when\\r\\nnarrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,\\r\\nthey have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I\\r\\ndeclare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,\\r\\nwhen he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon\\r\\ntestimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm\\r\\nWhale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously\\r\\nmalicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and\\r\\nsink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale has done it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,\\r\\nwas cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her\\r\\nboats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of\\r\\nthe whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping\\r\\nfrom the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the\\r\\nship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that\\r\\nin less than \\u201cten minutes\\u201d she settled down and fell over. Not a\\r\\nsurviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure,\\r\\npart of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home\\r\\nat last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of\\r\\nanother ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and\\r\\nbreakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith\\r\\nforswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain\\r\\nPollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was\\r\\nchief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his\\r\\nplain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all\\r\\nthis within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*The following are extracts from Chace\\u2019s narrative: \\u201cEvery fact\\r\\nseemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which\\r\\ndirected his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at\\r\\na short interval between them, both of which, according to their\\r\\ndirection, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made\\r\\nahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock;\\r\\nto effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary. His\\r\\naspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He\\r\\ncame directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in\\r\\nwhich we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with\\r\\nrevenge for their sufferings.\\u201d Again: \\u201cAt all events, the whole\\r\\ncircumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and\\r\\nproducing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating\\r\\nmischief, on the part of the whale (many of which impressions I\\r\\ncannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my\\r\\nopinion.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a\\r\\nblack night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any\\r\\nhospitable shore. \\u201cThe dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing;\\r\\nthe fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed\\r\\nupon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\\r\\ncontemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment\\u2019s thought; the\\r\\ndismal looking wreck, and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale,\\r\\nwholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn another place\\u2014p. 45,\\u2014he speaks of \\u201cthe mysterious and mortal\\r\\nattack of the animal.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807\\r\\ntotally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic\\r\\nparticulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,\\r\\nthough from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual allusions\\r\\nto it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J\\u2014-, then\\r\\ncommanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be\\r\\ndining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in\\r\\nthe harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,\\r\\nthe Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\\r\\nascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\\r\\ndenied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war\\r\\nas to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there\\r\\nis more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this\\r\\nimpregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a\\r\\nportly sperm whale, that begged a few moments\\u2019 confidential business\\r\\nwith him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore\\u2019s craft\\r\\nsuch a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the\\r\\nnearest port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I\\r\\nconsider the Commodore\\u2019s interview with that whale as providential.\\r\\nWas not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I\\r\\ntell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will now refer you to Langsdorff\\u2019s Voyages for a little circumstance\\r\\nin point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff,\\r\\nyou must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral\\r\\nKrusenstern\\u2019s famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the\\r\\npresent century. Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBy the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day\\r\\nwe were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was very\\r\\nclear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on\\r\\nour fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not\\r\\ntill the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up. An\\r\\nuncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself,\\r\\nlay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any\\r\\none on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail,\\r\\nwas almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking\\r\\nagainst him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this\\r\\ngigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at\\r\\nleast out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether,\\r\\nwhile we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding\\r\\nthat we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster\\r\\nsailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D\\u2019Wolf\\r\\napplied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel\\r\\nhad received any damage from the shock, but we found that very happily\\r\\nit had escaped entirely uninjured.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the Captain D\\u2019Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship\\r\\nin question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual\\r\\nadventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of\\r\\nDorchester near Boston. I have the honour of being a nephew of his. I\\r\\nhave particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.\\r\\nHe substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large\\r\\none: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my\\r\\nuncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,\\r\\ntoo, of honest wonders\\u2014the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient\\r\\nDampier\\u2019s old chums\\u2014I found a little matter set down so like that\\r\\njust quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for\\r\\na corroborative example, if such be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLionel, it seems, was on his way to \\u201cJohn Ferdinando,\\u201d as he calls\\r\\nthe modern Juan Fernandes. \\u201cIn our way thither,\\u201d he says, \\u201cabout\\r\\nfour o\\u2019clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty\\r\\nleagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which\\r\\nput our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they\\r\\nwere or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death. And,\\r\\nindeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted\\r\\nthe ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was a little\\r\\nover, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground..... The\\r\\nsuddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages, and\\r\\nseveral of the men were shaken out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who\\r\\nlay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his cabin!\\u201d Lionel then\\r\\ngoes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and seems to substantiate\\r\\nthe imputation by stating that a great earthquake, somewhere about\\r\\nthat time, did actually do great mischief along the Spanish land. But\\r\\nI should not much wonder if, in the darkness of that early hour of the\\r\\nmorning, the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically\\r\\nbumping the hull from beneath.\\r\\n\\r\\nI might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to\\r\\nme, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more\\r\\nthan one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\\r\\nboats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\\r\\nwithstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\\r\\nPusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength,\\r\\nlet me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a\\r\\nrunning sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and\\r\\nsecured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a\\r\\nhorse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if\\r\\nthe sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,\\r\\nnot so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of\\r\\ndestruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent\\r\\nindication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently\\r\\nopen his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several\\r\\nconsecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more and a\\r\\nconcluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one, by which\\r\\nyou will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in\\r\\nthis book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these\\r\\nmarvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for\\r\\nthe millionth time we say amen with Solomon\\u2014Verily there is nothing\\r\\nnew under the sun.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate\\r\\nof Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius\\r\\ngeneral. As many know, he wrote the history of his own times, a work\\r\\nevery way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he has always been\\r\\nconsidered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian, except in\\r\\nsome one or two particulars, not at all affecting the matter presently\\r\\nto be mentioned.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term\\r\\nof his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured\\r\\nin the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed\\r\\nvessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty\\r\\nyears. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be\\r\\ngainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species\\r\\nthis sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as\\r\\nwell as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly\\r\\ninclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long\\r\\ntime I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the\\r\\nMediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am\\r\\ncertain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the\\r\\npresent constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious\\r\\nresort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in\\r\\nmodern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the\\r\\nsperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that\\r\\non the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found\\r\\nthe skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes\\r\\nthrough the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,\\r\\npass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance\\r\\ncalled brit is to be found, the aliment of the right whale. But I have\\r\\nevery reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale\\u2014squid or\\r\\ncuttle-fish\\u2014lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures,\\r\\nbut by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its\\r\\nsurface. If, then, you properly put these statements together, and\\r\\nreason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to\\r\\nall human reasoning, Procopius\\u2019s sea-monster, that for half a century\\r\\nstove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a\\r\\nsperm whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 46. Surmises.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his\\r\\nthoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick;\\r\\nthough he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one\\r\\npassion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long\\r\\nhabituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman\\u2019s ways, altogether to\\r\\nabandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if\\r\\nthis were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more\\r\\ninfluential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even\\r\\nconsidering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the\\r\\nWhite Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all\\r\\nsperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he\\r\\nmultiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would\\r\\nprove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be indeed\\r\\nexceptionable, there were still additional considerations which, though\\r\\nnot so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion, yet\\r\\nwere by no means incapable of swaying him.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in\\r\\nthe shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,\\r\\nfor example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was\\r\\nover Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual\\r\\nman any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual\\r\\nmastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in\\r\\na sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck\\u2019s body and Starbuck\\u2019s coerced\\r\\nwill were Ahab\\u2019s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\\u2019s\\r\\nbrain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his\\r\\nsoul, abhorred his captain\\u2019s quest, and could he, would joyfully\\r\\ndisintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that\\r\\na long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that\\r\\nlong interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses\\r\\nof rebellion against his captain\\u2019s leadership, unless some ordinary,\\r\\nprudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him.\\r\\nNot only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was\\r\\nnoways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and\\r\\nshrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some\\r\\nway be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally\\r\\ninvested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn\\r\\ninto the obscure background (for few men\\u2019s courage is proof against\\r\\nprotracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their\\r\\nlong night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to\\r\\nthink of than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage\\r\\ncrew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all\\r\\nsorts are more or less capricious and unreliable\\u2014they live in the\\r\\nvarying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness\\u2014and when\\r\\nretained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however\\r\\npromissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things\\r\\nrequisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and\\r\\nhold them healthily suspended for the final dash.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion\\r\\nmankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.\\r\\nThe permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought\\r\\nAhab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the\\r\\nhearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even\\r\\nbreeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the\\r\\nlove of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food\\r\\nfor their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and\\r\\nchivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two\\r\\nthousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without\\r\\ncommitting burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious\\r\\nperquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final\\r\\nand romantic object\\u2014that final and romantic object, too many would\\r\\nhave turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab,\\r\\nof all hopes of cash\\u2014aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some\\r\\nmonths go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this\\r\\nsame quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would\\r\\nsoon cashier Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related\\r\\nto Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps\\r\\nsomewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the\\r\\nPequod\\u2019s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing,\\r\\nhe had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of\\r\\nusurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew\\r\\nif so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further\\r\\nobedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From\\r\\neven the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible\\r\\nconsequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must\\r\\nof course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection\\r\\ncould only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,\\r\\nbacked by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute\\r\\natmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected\\r\\nto.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be\\r\\nverbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good\\r\\ndegree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\nvoyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force\\r\\nhimself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general\\r\\npursuit of his profession.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three\\r\\nmast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit\\r\\nreporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging\\r\\nabout the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.\\r\\nQueequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,\\r\\nfor an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet\\r\\nsomehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie\\r\\nlurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own\\r\\ninvisible self.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I\\r\\nkept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between\\r\\nthe long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as\\r\\nQueequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword\\r\\nbetween the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly and\\r\\nunthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess did\\r\\nthere then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only broken by\\r\\nthe intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as if this were\\r\\nthe Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving\\r\\nand weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of the warp\\r\\nsubject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging vibration, and\\r\\nthat vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending\\r\\nof other threads with its own. This warp seemed necessity; and here,\\r\\nthought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle and weave my own\\r\\ndestiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime, Queequeg\\u2019s\\r\\nimpulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof slantingly,\\r\\nor crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be; and by this\\r\\ndifference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in\\r\\nthe final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage\\u2019s sword, thought\\r\\nI, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof; this\\r\\neasy, indifferent sword must be chance\\u2014aye, chance, free will, and\\r\\nnecessity\\u2014nowise incompatible\\u2014all interweavingly working together.\\r\\nThe straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its ultimate\\r\\ncourse\\u2014its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending to that;\\r\\nfree will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads; and\\r\\nchance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of\\r\\nnecessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though\\r\\nthus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the\\r\\nlast featuring blow at events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so\\r\\nstrange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball\\r\\nof free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds\\r\\nwhence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees was\\r\\nthat mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly forward,\\r\\nhis hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden intervals he\\r\\ncontinued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that very moment\\r\\nperhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of whalemen\\u2019s\\r\\nlook-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those lungs could\\r\\nthat accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from\\r\\nTashtego the Indian\\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and\\r\\neagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some\\r\\nprophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries\\r\\nannouncing their coming.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere-away?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOn the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly all was commotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and\\r\\nreliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from\\r\\nother tribes of his genus.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere go flukes!\\u201d was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales\\r\\ndisappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQuick, steward!\\u201d cried Ahab. \\u201cTime! time!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact\\r\\nminute to Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling\\r\\nbefore it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to\\r\\nleeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of\\r\\nour bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale\\r\\nwhen, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while\\r\\nconcealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the\\r\\nopposite quarter\\u2014this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action;\\r\\nfor there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had\\r\\nbeen in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity. One of\\r\\nthe men selected for shipkeepers\\u2014that is, those not appointed to\\r\\nthe boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the main-mast head. The\\r\\nsailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed\\r\\nin their places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed,\\r\\nand the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over\\r\\nhigh cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand\\r\\nclung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale.\\r\\nSo look the long line of man-of-war\\u2019s men about to throw themselves on\\r\\nboard an enemy\\u2019s ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took\\r\\nevery eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was\\r\\nsurrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side\\r\\nof the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the\\r\\ntackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always\\r\\nbeen deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the\\r\\ncaptain\\u2019s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The\\r\\nfigure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white\\r\\ntooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese\\r\\njacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers\\r\\nof the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a\\r\\nglistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled\\r\\nround and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of\\r\\nthis figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to\\r\\nsome of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;\\u2014a race notorious for\\r\\na certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners\\r\\nsupposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the\\r\\nwater of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be\\r\\nelsewhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile yet the wondering ship\\u2019s company were gazing upon these\\r\\nstrangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,\\r\\n\\u201cAll ready there, Fedallah?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cReady,\\u201d was the half-hissed reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLower away then; d\\u2019ye hear?\\u201d shouting across the deck. \\u201cLower\\r\\naway there, I say.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the men\\r\\nsprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with a\\r\\nwallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a dexterous,\\r\\noff-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the sailors,\\r\\ngoat-like, leaped down the rolling ship\\u2019s side into the tossed boats\\r\\nbelow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHardly had they pulled out from under the ship\\u2019s lee, when a fourth\\r\\nkeel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and\\r\\nshowed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the stern,\\r\\nloudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely,\\r\\nso as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again\\r\\nriveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other\\r\\nboats obeyed not the command.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Ahab?\\u2014\\u201d said Starbuck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSpread yourselves,\\u201d cried Ahab; \\u201cgive way, all four boats. Thou,\\r\\nFlask, pull out more to leeward!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir,\\u201d cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round\\r\\nhis great steering oar. \\u201cLay back!\\u201d addressing his crew.\\r\\n\\u201cThere!\\u2014there!\\u2014there again! There she blows right ahead,\\r\\nboys!\\u2014lay back!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNever heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t mind\\u2019em, sir,\\u201d said Archy; \\u201cI knew it all before\\r\\nnow. Didn\\u2019t I hear \\u2018em in the hold? And didn\\u2019t I tell Cabaco here\\r\\nof it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\\r\\nones,\\u201d drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of\\r\\nwhom still showed signs of uneasiness. \\u201cWhy don\\u2019t you break your\\r\\nbackbones, my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat?\\r\\nTut! They are only five more hands come to help us\\u2014never mind from\\r\\nwhere\\u2014the more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the\\r\\nbrimstone\\u2014devils are good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now;\\r\\nthat\\u2019s the stroke for a thousand pounds; that\\u2019s the stroke to sweep\\r\\nthe stakes! Hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes!\\r\\nThree cheers, men\\u2014all hearts alive! Easy, easy; don\\u2019t be in a\\r\\nhurry\\u2014don\\u2019t be in a hurry. Why don\\u2019t you snap your oars, you\\r\\nrascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so, then:\\u2014softly, softly!\\r\\nThat\\u2019s it\\u2014that\\u2019s it! long and strong. Give way there, give way!\\r\\nThe devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are all asleep. Stop\\r\\nsnoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull, can\\u2019t ye? pull,\\r\\nwon\\u2019t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes don\\u2019t\\r\\nye pull?\\u2014pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!\\r\\nHere!\\u201d whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; \\u201cevery\\r\\nmother\\u2019s son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his\\r\\nteeth. That\\u2019s it\\u2014that\\u2019s it. Now ye do something; that looks like\\r\\nit, my steel-bits. Start her\\u2014start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,\\r\\nmarling-spikes!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb\\u2019s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had\\r\\nrather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in\\r\\ninculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this\\r\\nspecimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\\r\\nwith his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief\\r\\npeculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a\\r\\ntone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so\\r\\ncalculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear such\\r\\nqueer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for\\r\\nthe mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and\\r\\nindolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly\\r\\ngaped\\u2014open-mouthed at times\\u2014that the mere sight of such a yawning\\r\\ncommander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew.\\r\\nThen again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity\\r\\nis sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their\\r\\nguard in the matter of obeying them.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\\r\\nacross Stubb\\u2019s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\\r\\npretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye\\r\\nplease!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHalloa!\\u201d returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\\r\\nspoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set\\r\\nlike a flint from Stubb\\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat think ye of those yellow boys, sir!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSmuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,\\r\\nboys!)\\u201d in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: \\u201cA\\r\\nsad business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never\\r\\nmind, Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come\\r\\nwhat will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There\\u2019s hogsheads of sperm\\r\\nahead, Mr. Stubb, and that\\u2019s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm,\\r\\nsperm\\u2019s the play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in\\r\\nhand.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye, I thought as much,\\u201d soliloquized Stubb, when the boats\\r\\ndiverged, \\u201cas soon as I clapt eye on \\u2018em, I thought so. Aye, and\\r\\nthat\\u2019s what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy\\r\\nlong suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale\\u2019s at the\\r\\nbottom of it. Well, well, so be it! Can\\u2019t be helped! All right! Give\\r\\nway, men! It ain\\u2019t the White Whale to-day! Give way!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant\\r\\nas the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably\\r\\nawakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship\\u2019s\\r\\ncompany; but Archy\\u2019s fancied discovery having some time previous got\\r\\nabroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some\\r\\nsmall measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge\\r\\nof their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb\\u2019s confident way\\r\\nof accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from\\r\\nsuperstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for\\r\\nall manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab\\u2019s precise agency in the\\r\\nmatter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious\\r\\nshadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the dim Nantucket\\r\\ndawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable Elijah.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\\r\\nfurthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\\r\\ncircumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger\\r\\nyellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five\\r\\ntrip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which\\r\\nperiodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\\r\\nboiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen\\r\\npulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and\\r\\ndisplayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\\r\\ngunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\\r\\nhorizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\\r\\nfencer\\u2019s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance\\r\\nany tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar\\r\\nas in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All\\r\\nat once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained\\r\\nfixed, while the boat\\u2019s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked.\\r\\nBoat and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread\\r\\nboats in the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly\\r\\nsettled bodily down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible\\r\\ntoken of the movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEvery man look out along his oars!\\u201d cried Starbuck. \\u201cThou,\\r\\nQueequeg, stand up!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\\r\\nstood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\\r\\nspot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\\r\\nstern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\\r\\nthe gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\\r\\nhimself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\\r\\neyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot very far distant Flask\\u2019s boat was also lying breathlessly still;\\r\\nits commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a\\r\\nstout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above\\r\\nthe level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with\\r\\nthe whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man\\u2019s\\r\\nhand, and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the\\r\\nmast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little\\r\\nKing-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post was\\r\\nfull of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point\\r\\nof his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI can\\u2019t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on\\r\\nto that.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his\\r\\nway, swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty\\r\\nshoulders for a pedestal.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\\r\\nfifty feet taller.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\\r\\nboat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm\\r\\nto Flask\\u2019s foot, and then putting Flask\\u2019s hand on his hearse-plumed\\r\\nhead and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one\\r\\ndexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And\\r\\nhere was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him\\r\\nwith a breastband to lean against and steady himself by.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\\r\\nhabitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect\\r\\nposture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously\\r\\nperverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily\\r\\nperched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\\r\\nsight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious;\\r\\nfor sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of,\\r\\nbarbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously\\r\\nrolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed\\r\\na snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly\\r\\nvivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then\\r\\nstamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to\\r\\nthe negro\\u2019s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping\\r\\nthe living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and\\r\\nher seasons for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing\\r\\nsolicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,\\r\\nnot a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,\\r\\nStubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\\r\\nlanguishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\\r\\nwhere he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\\r\\nhome the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match\\r\\nacross the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer,\\r\\nwhose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly\\r\\ndropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in\\r\\na quick phrensy of hurry, \\u201cDown, down all, and give way!\\u2014there they\\r\\nare!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\\r\\nvisible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\\r\\nwater, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and\\r\\nsuffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\\r\\nrolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\\r\\nwere, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\\r\\natmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\\r\\nwater, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\\r\\nindications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed their forerunning\\r\\ncouriers and detached flying outriders.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\\r\\nwater and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,\\r\\nas a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\\r\\nhills.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPull, pull, my good boys,\\u201d said Starbuck, in the lowest possible\\r\\nbut intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed\\r\\nglance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as\\r\\ntwo visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say\\r\\nmuch to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\\r\\nsilence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\\r\\npeculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow different the loud little King-Post. \\u201cSing out and say something,\\r\\nmy hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their\\r\\nblack backs, boys; only do that for me, and I\\u2019ll sign over to you my\\r\\nMartha\\u2019s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys.\\r\\nLay me on\\u2014lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!\\r\\nSee! see that white water!\\u201d And so shouting, he pulled his hat from\\r\\nhis head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it\\r\\nfar off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the\\r\\nboat\\u2019s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook at that chap now,\\u201d philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with\\r\\nhis unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at\\r\\na short distance, followed after\\u2014\\u201cHe\\u2019s got fits, that Flask has.\\r\\nFits? yes, give him fits\\u2014that\\u2019s the very word\\u2014pitch fits\\r\\ninto \\u2018em. Merrily, merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you\\r\\nknow;\\u2014merry\\u2019s the word. Pull, babes\\u2014pull, sucklings\\u2014pull, all.\\r\\nBut what the devil are you hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily,\\r\\nmy men. Only pull, and keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your\\r\\nbackbones, and bite your knives in two\\u2014that\\u2019s all. Take it\\r\\neasy\\u2014why don\\u2019t ye take it easy, I say, and burst all your livers and\\r\\nlungs!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\\r\\nhis\\u2014these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed\\r\\nlight of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious\\r\\nseas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of\\r\\nred murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of\\r\\nFlask to \\u201cthat whale,\\u201d as he called the fictitious monster which\\r\\nhe declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat\\u2019s bow with its\\r\\ntail\\u2014these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that\\r\\nthey would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look\\r\\nover the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen\\r\\nmust put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage\\r\\npronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but\\r\\narms, in these critical moments.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the\\r\\nomnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along\\r\\nthe eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green;\\r\\nthe brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on\\r\\nthe knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening\\r\\nto cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and\\r\\nhollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite\\r\\nhill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;\\u2014all these,\\r\\nwith the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps\\r\\nof the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing\\r\\ndown upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her\\r\\nscreaming brood;\\u2014all this was thrilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever\\r\\nheat of his first battle; not the dead man\\u2019s ghost encountering the\\r\\nfirst unknown phantom in the other world;\\u2014neither of these can feel\\r\\nstranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first\\r\\ntime finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the\\r\\nhunted sperm whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more\\r\\nvisible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows\\r\\nflung upon the sea. The jets of vapour no longer blended, but tilted\\r\\neverywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.\\r\\nThe boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales\\r\\nrunning dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still\\r\\nrising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through\\r\\nthe water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to\\r\\nescape being torn from the row-locks.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship\\r\\nnor boat to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGive way, men,\\u201d whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the\\r\\nsheet of his sail; \\u201cthere is time to kill a fish yet before the squall\\r\\ncomes. There\\u2019s white water again!\\u2014close to! Spring!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted\\r\\nthat the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when\\r\\nwith a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: \\u201cStand up!\\u201d\\r\\nand Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril\\r\\nso close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance\\r\\nof the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent\\r\\ninstant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of\\r\\nfifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still\\r\\nbooming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like\\r\\nthe erected crests of enraged serpents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s his hump. There, there, give it to him!\\u201d whispered\\r\\nStarbuck.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of\\r\\nQueequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\\r\\nastern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail\\r\\ncollapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapour shot up near by;\\r\\nsomething rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole\\r\\ncrew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the\\r\\nwhite curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all\\r\\nblended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round\\r\\nit we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,\\r\\ntumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the\\r\\nwater covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes\\r\\nthe suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom\\r\\nof the ocean.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;\\r\\nthe whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white\\r\\nfire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal\\r\\nin these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar\\r\\nto the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those\\r\\nboats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew\\r\\ndarker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.\\r\\nThe rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were\\r\\nuseless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.\\r\\nSo, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many failures\\r\\nStarbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then stretching\\r\\nit on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the standard-bearer of this\\r\\nforlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up that imbecile candle in\\r\\nthe heart of that almighty forlornness. There, then, he sat, the sign\\r\\nand symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly holding up hope in the\\r\\nmidst of despair.\\r\\n\\r\\nWet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,\\r\\nwe lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over\\r\\nthe sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.\\r\\nSuddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.\\r\\nWe all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by\\r\\nthe storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were dimly\\r\\nparted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the sea as\\r\\nthe ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us within a\\r\\ndistance of not much more than its length.\\r\\n\\r\\nFloating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it\\r\\ntossed and gaped beneath the ship\\u2019s bows like a chip at the base of a\\r\\ncataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no\\r\\nmore till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were dashed\\r\\nagainst it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely landed on\\r\\nboard. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut loose from\\r\\ntheir fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship had given us\\r\\nup, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon some token of\\r\\nour perishing,\\u2014an oar or a lance pole.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 49. The Hyena.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair\\r\\nwe call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical\\r\\njoke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more than\\r\\nsuspects that the joke is at nobody\\u2019s expense but his own. However,\\r\\nnothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He bolts\\r\\ndown all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all hard\\r\\nthings visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich of\\r\\npotent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for small\\r\\ndifficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril of\\r\\nlife and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,\\r\\ngood-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen\\r\\nand unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am speaking\\r\\nof, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation; it comes\\r\\nin the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before might\\r\\nhave seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part of the\\r\\ngeneral joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this\\r\\nfree and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with it I now\\r\\nregarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White Whale its\\r\\nobject.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQueequeg,\\u201d said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to\\r\\nthe deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off\\r\\nthe water; \\u201cQueequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often\\r\\nhappen?\\u201d Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he\\r\\ngave me to understand that such things did often happen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMr. Stubb,\\u201d said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his\\r\\noil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; \\u201cMr. Stubb, I\\r\\nthink I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief\\r\\nmate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose\\r\\nthen, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy\\r\\nsquall is the height of a whaleman\\u2019s discretion?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCertain. I\\u2019ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off\\r\\nCape Horn.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMr. Flask,\\u201d said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing\\r\\nclose by; \\u201cyou are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you\\r\\ntell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,\\r\\nfor an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into\\r\\ndeath\\u2019s jaws?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCan\\u2019t you twist that smaller?\\u201d said Flask. \\u201cYes, that\\u2019s the\\r\\nlaw. I should like to see a boat\\u2019s crew backing water up to a whale\\r\\nface foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind\\r\\nthat!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement\\r\\nof the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings\\r\\nin the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters\\r\\nof common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the\\r\\nsuperlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign\\r\\nmy life into the hands of him who steered the boat\\u2014oftentimes a\\r\\nfellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of\\r\\nscuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that the\\r\\nparticular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed\\r\\nto Starbuck\\u2019s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall,\\r\\nand considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for his\\r\\ngreat heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to this\\r\\nuncommonly prudent Starbuck\\u2019s boat; and finally considering in what a\\r\\ndevil\\u2019s chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking all\\r\\nthings together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make a\\r\\nrough draft of my will. \\u201cQueequeg,\\u201d said I, \\u201ccome along, you shall\\r\\nbe my lawyer, executor, and legatee.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their\\r\\nlast wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world more\\r\\nfond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical life\\r\\nthat I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded upon\\r\\nthe present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled away\\r\\nfrom my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as good\\r\\nas the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a supplementary\\r\\nclean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be. I survived\\r\\nmyself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest. I looked\\r\\nround me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a clean\\r\\nconscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,\\r\\nhere goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the\\r\\ndevil fetch the hindmost.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 50. Ahab\\u2019s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho would have thought it, Flask!\\u201d cried Stubb; \\u201cif I had but one\\r\\nleg you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole\\r\\nwith my timber toe. Oh! he\\u2019s a wonderful old man!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it so strange, after all, on that account,\\u201d said\\r\\nFlask. \\u201cIf his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different\\r\\nthing. That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the\\r\\nother left, you know.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering\\r\\nthe paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it is\\r\\nright for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils\\r\\nof the chase. So Tamerlane\\u2019s soldiers often argued with tears in their\\r\\neyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the\\r\\nthickest of the fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering\\r\\nthat with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;\\r\\nconsidering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and\\r\\nextraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then\\r\\ncomprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any\\r\\nmaimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the\\r\\njoint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of\\r\\nhis entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of\\r\\nthe chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving\\r\\nhis orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually\\r\\napportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt\\u2014above all for\\r\\nCaptain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat\\u2019s\\r\\ncrew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads\\r\\nof the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat\\u2019s\\r\\ncrew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.\\r\\nNevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that\\r\\nmatter. Until Cabaco\\u2019s published discovery, the sailors had little\\r\\nforeseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out\\r\\nof port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the\\r\\nwhaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then\\r\\nfound bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his\\r\\nown hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even\\r\\nsolicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is\\r\\nrunning out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was\\r\\nobserved in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra\\r\\ncoat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\\r\\nwithstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety\\r\\nhe evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is\\r\\nsometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat\\u2019s bow for bracing\\r\\nthe knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was\\r\\nobserved how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed\\r\\nin the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter\\u2019s\\r\\nchisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all\\r\\nthese things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the\\r\\ntime. But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative\\r\\nheedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of\\r\\nMoby Dick; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal\\r\\nmonster in person. But such a supposition did by no means involve the\\r\\nremotest suspicion as to any boat\\u2019s crew being assigned to that boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned\\r\\naway; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such\\r\\nunaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown\\r\\nnooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of\\r\\nwhalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway\\r\\ncreatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,\\r\\noars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that\\r\\nBeelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin\\r\\nto chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable\\r\\nexcitement in the forecastle.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate\\r\\nphantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were\\r\\nsomehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained\\r\\na muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like\\r\\nthis, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be\\r\\nlinked with Ahab\\u2019s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort\\r\\nof a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even\\r\\nauthority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain\\r\\nan indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as\\r\\ncivilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their\\r\\ndreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide\\r\\namong the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles\\r\\nto the east of the continent\\u2014those insulated, immemorial, unalterable\\r\\ncountries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the\\r\\nghostly aboriginalness of earth\\u2019s primal generations, when the\\r\\nmemory of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his\\r\\ndescendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms,\\r\\nand asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end;\\r\\nwhen though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the\\r\\ndaughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged\\r\\nin mundane amours.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.\\r\\n\\r\\nDays, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly\\r\\nswept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off the\\r\\nCape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of the\\r\\nRio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery locality,\\r\\nsoutherly from St. Helena.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and\\r\\nmoonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;\\r\\nand, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery\\r\\nsilence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen\\r\\nfar in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it\\r\\nlooked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from\\r\\nthe sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight\\r\\nnights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a\\r\\nlook-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,\\r\\nthough herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred\\r\\nwould venture a lowering for them. You may think with what emotions,\\r\\nthen, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual\\r\\nhours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But when, after\\r\\nspending his uniform interval there for several successive nights\\r\\nwithout uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence, his\\r\\nunearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every\\r\\nreclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had\\r\\nlighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. \\u201cThere she\\r\\nblows!\\u201d Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered\\r\\nmore; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was\\r\\na most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously\\r\\nexciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a\\r\\nlowering.\\r\\n\\r\\nWalking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the\\r\\nt\\u2019gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The\\r\\nbest man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head\\r\\nmanned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,\\r\\nupheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows\\r\\nof so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air\\r\\nbeneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic\\r\\ninfluences were struggling in her\\u2014one to mount direct to heaven, the\\r\\nother to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two\\r\\ndifferent things were warring. While his one live leg made lively echoes\\r\\nalong the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffin-tap.\\r\\nOn life and death this old man walked. But though the ship so swiftly\\r\\nsped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager glances shot,\\r\\nyet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every sailor swore he\\r\\nsaw it once, but not a second time.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days\\r\\nafter, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it\\r\\nwas descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it\\r\\ndisappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after\\r\\nnight, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously\\r\\njetted into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;\\r\\ndisappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and somehow\\r\\nseeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and\\r\\nfurther in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance\\r\\nwith the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested\\r\\nthe Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that\\r\\nwhenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however\\r\\nfar apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast\\r\\nby one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there\\r\\nreigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition,\\r\\nas if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the\\r\\nmonster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest\\r\\nand most savage seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a wondrous\\r\\npotency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in which, beneath\\r\\nall its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a devilish charm, as\\r\\nfor days and days we voyaged along, through seas so wearily, lonesomely\\r\\nmild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful errand, seemed\\r\\nvacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began howling\\r\\naround us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas that are\\r\\nthere; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the blast, and\\r\\ngored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of silver chips,\\r\\nthe foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this desolate vacuity\\r\\nof life went away, but gave place to sights more dismal than before.\\r\\n\\r\\nClose to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither\\r\\nbefore us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And\\r\\nevery morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and\\r\\nspite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,\\r\\nas though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a thing\\r\\nappointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for their\\r\\nhomeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved the\\r\\nblack sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great mundane\\r\\nsoul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had\\r\\nbred.\\r\\n\\r\\nCape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoto, as called\\r\\nof yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had\\r\\nattended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea,\\r\\nwhere guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed\\r\\ncondemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat\\r\\nthat black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and unvarying;\\r\\nstill directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still beckoning us\\r\\non from before, the solitary jet would at times be descried.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for the\\r\\ntime the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck,\\r\\nmanifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever addressed\\r\\nhis mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything above and\\r\\naloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but passively to await\\r\\nthe issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become practical fatalists.\\r\\nSo, with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole, and with one\\r\\nhand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for hours and hours would stand\\r\\ngazing dead to windward, while an occasional squall of sleet or snow\\r\\nwould all but congeal his very eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew\\r\\ndriven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that\\r\\nburstingly broke over its bows, stood in a line along the bulwarks in\\r\\nthe waist; and the better to guard against the leaping waves, each man\\r\\nhad slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which\\r\\nhe swung as in a loosened belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the\\r\\nsilent ship, as if manned by painted sailors in wax, day after day tore\\r\\non through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves.\\r\\nBy night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the\\r\\nocean prevailed; still in silence the men swung in the bowlines; still\\r\\nwordless Ahab stood up to the blast. Even when wearied nature seemed\\r\\ndemanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock. Never\\r\\ncould Starbuck forget the old man\\u2019s aspect, when one night going down\\r\\ninto the cabin to mark how the barometer stood, he saw him with\\r\\nclosed eyes sitting straight in his floor-screwed chair; the rain\\r\\nand half-melted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before\\r\\nemerged, still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat. On the\\r\\ntable beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents\\r\\nwhich have previously been spoken of. His lantern swung from his tightly\\r\\nclenched hand. Though the body was erect, the head was thrown back so\\r\\nthat the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale\\r\\nthat swung from a beam in the ceiling.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to the\\r\\ncompass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself of the\\r\\ncourse of the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nTerrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this\\r\\ngale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 52. The Albatross.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising\\r\\nground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)\\r\\nby name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the\\r\\nfore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro\\r\\nin the far ocean fisheries\\u2014a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the\\r\\nskeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral\\r\\nappearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her\\r\\nspars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over\\r\\nwith hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to\\r\\nsee her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed\\r\\nclad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had\\r\\nsurvived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to\\r\\nthe mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when\\r\\nthe ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air\\r\\ncame so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the\\r\\nmast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking\\r\\nfishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own\\r\\nlook-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShip ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the\\r\\nact of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand\\r\\ninto the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make\\r\\nhimself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing the\\r\\ndistance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the Pequod\\r\\nwere evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first\\r\\nmere mention of the White Whale\\u2019s name to another ship, Ahab for a\\r\\nmoment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat\\r\\nto board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But taking\\r\\nadvantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet, and\\r\\nknowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer and\\r\\nshortly bound home, he loudly hailed\\u2014\\u201cAhoy there! This is the\\r\\nPequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters\\r\\nto the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,\\r\\ntell them to address them to\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,\\r\\nin accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,\\r\\nthat for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side, darted\\r\\naway with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves fore and\\r\\naft with the stranger\\u2019s flanks. Though in the course of his continual\\r\\nvoyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to\\r\\nany monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSwim away from me, do ye?\\u201d murmured Ahab, gazing over into the\\r\\nwater. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed\\r\\nmore of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before\\r\\nevinced. But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the\\r\\nship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion\\r\\nvoice,\\u2014\\u201cUp helm! Keep her off round the world!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nRound the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;\\r\\nbut whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through\\r\\nnumberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that\\r\\nwe left behind secure, were all the time before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWere this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for\\r\\never reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange\\r\\nthan any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise\\r\\nin the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in\\r\\ntormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims\\r\\nbefore all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they\\r\\neither lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 53. The Gam.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had\\r\\nspoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had\\r\\nthis not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded\\r\\nher\\u2014judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions\\u2014if so\\r\\nit had been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative\\r\\nanswer to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he\\r\\ncared not to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain,\\r\\nexcept he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly\\r\\nsought. But all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not\\r\\nsomething said here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when\\r\\nmeeting each other in foreign seas, and especially on a common\\r\\ncruising-ground.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the\\r\\nequally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering\\r\\neach other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of\\r\\nthem, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment\\r\\nto interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while\\r\\nand resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the\\r\\nillimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling\\r\\nvessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth\\u2014off lone\\r\\nFanning\\u2019s Island, or the far away King\\u2019s Mills; how much more\\r\\nnatural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not\\r\\nonly interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and\\r\\nsociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of\\r\\ncourse, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains,\\r\\nofficers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other;\\r\\nand consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on\\r\\nboard; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a\\r\\ndate a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumb-worn\\r\\nfiles. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound ship would\\r\\nreceive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruising-ground to\\r\\nwhich she may be destined, a thing of the utmost importance to her. And\\r\\nin degree, all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing\\r\\neach other\\u2019s track on the cruising-ground itself, even though they\\r\\nare equally long absent from home. For one of them may have received a\\r\\ntransfer of letters from some third, and now far remote vessel; and\\r\\nsome of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets.\\r\\nBesides, they would exchange the whaling news, and have an agreeable\\r\\nchat. For not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors,\\r\\nbut likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common\\r\\npursuit and mutually shared privations and perils.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor would difference of country make any very essential difference;\\r\\nthat is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case\\r\\nwith Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number of\\r\\nEnglish whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when they\\r\\ndo occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them; for your\\r\\nEnglishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not fancy that\\r\\nsort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English whalers\\r\\nsometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the American\\r\\nwhalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his nondescript\\r\\nprovincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this superiority\\r\\nin the English whalemen does really consist, it would be hard to say,\\r\\nseeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill more whales than\\r\\nall the English, collectively, in ten years. But this is a harmless\\r\\nlittle foible in the English whale-hunters, which the Nantucketer does\\r\\nnot take much to heart; probably, because he knows that he has a few\\r\\nfoibles himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the\\r\\nwhalers have most reason to be sociable\\u2014and they are so. Whereas, some\\r\\nmerchant ships crossing each other\\u2019s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will\\r\\noftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,\\r\\nmutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies in\\r\\nBroadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism upon\\r\\neach other\\u2019s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at sea,\\r\\nthey first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings, such\\r\\na ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be much right-down\\r\\nhearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As touching\\r\\nSlave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry, they run\\r\\naway from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates, when they\\r\\nchance to cross each other\\u2019s cross-bones, the first hail is\\u2014\\u201cHow\\r\\nmany skulls?\\u201d\\u2014the same way that whalers hail\\u2014\\u201cHow many\\r\\nbarrels?\\u201d And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer\\r\\napart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don\\u2019t like to\\r\\nsee overmuch of each other\\u2019s villanous likenesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,\\r\\nfree-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another\\r\\nwhaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a \\u201cGam,\\u201d a thing so\\r\\nutterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name\\r\\neven; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and\\r\\nrepeat gamesome stuff about \\u201cspouters\\u201d and \\u201cblubber-boilers,\\u201d\\r\\nand such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen,\\r\\nand also all Pirates and Man-of-War\\u2019s men, and Slave-ship sailors,\\r\\ncherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question\\r\\nit would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I\\r\\nshould like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar\\r\\nglory about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but\\r\\nonly at the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd\\r\\nfashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence,\\r\\nI conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,\\r\\nin that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what is a Gam? You might wear out your index-finger running up and\\r\\ndown the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr. Johnson\\r\\nnever attained to that erudition; Noah Webster\\u2019s ark does not hold it.\\r\\nNevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years been in\\r\\nconstant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees. Certainly,\\r\\nit needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the Lexicon. With\\r\\nthat view, let me learnedly define it.\\r\\n\\r\\nGAM. NOUN\\u2014A social meeting of two (or more) Whaleships, generally on\\r\\na cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange visits\\r\\nby boats\\u2019 crews; the two captains remaining, for the time, on board of\\r\\none ship, and the two chief mates on the other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten\\r\\nhere. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\\r\\nhas the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when\\r\\nthe captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern\\r\\nsheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often\\r\\nsteers himself with a pretty little milliner\\u2019s tiller decorated with\\r\\ngay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of\\r\\nthat sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling\\r\\ncaptains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen\\r\\nin patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of\\r\\nany such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat\\u2019s\\r\\ncrew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is\\r\\nof the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and\\r\\nthe captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit\\r\\nall standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that being\\r\\nconscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from\\r\\nthe sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to the\\r\\nimportance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is\\r\\nthis any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting\\r\\nsteering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the\\r\\nafter-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus\\r\\ncompletely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself\\r\\nsideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent\\r\\npitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of\\r\\nfoundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a\\r\\nspread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,\\r\\nit would never do in plain sight of the world\\u2019s riveted eyes, it\\r\\nwould never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying\\r\\nhimself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with\\r\\nhis hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he\\r\\ngenerally carries his hands in his trowsers\\u2019 pockets; but perhaps\\r\\nbeing generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for\\r\\nballast. Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated\\r\\nones too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical\\r\\nmoment or two, in a sudden squall say\\u2014to seize hold of the nearest\\r\\noarsman\\u2019s hair, and hold on there like grim death.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho\\u2019s Story.\\r\\n\\r\\n(As told at the Golden Inn)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is\\r\\nmuch like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet\\r\\nmore travellers than in any other part.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not very long after speaking the Goney that another\\r\\nhomeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned\\r\\nalmost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave\\r\\nus strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White\\r\\nWhale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho\\u2019s\\r\\nstory, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain\\r\\nwondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of God\\r\\nwhich at times are said to overtake some men. This latter circumstance,\\r\\nwith its own particular accompaniments, forming what may be called the\\r\\nsecret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never reached the ears\\r\\nof Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of the story was\\r\\nunknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the private\\r\\nproperty of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of whom, it\\r\\nseems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of secrecy,\\r\\nbut the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and revealed\\r\\nso much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could not well\\r\\nwithhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did this thing\\r\\nhave on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full knowledge of\\r\\nit, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were they governed in\\r\\nthis matter, that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never\\r\\ntranspired abaft the Pequod\\u2019s main-mast. Interweaving in its proper\\r\\nplace this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the\\r\\nship, the whole of this strange affair I now proceed to put on lasting\\r\\nrecord.\\r\\n\\r\\n*The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,\\r\\nstill used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor my humor\\u2019s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once\\r\\nnarrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one\\r\\nsaint\\u2019s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden\\r\\nInn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were\\r\\non the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they\\r\\noccasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSome two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about\\r\\nrehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,\\r\\nwas cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days\\u2019 sail eastward\\r\\nfrom the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the\\r\\nnorthward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according to\\r\\ndaily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold than\\r\\ncommon. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But the\\r\\ncaptain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck\\r\\nawaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to quit\\r\\nthem, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous, though,\\r\\nindeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low down\\r\\nas was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued her\\r\\ncruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals;\\r\\nbut no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was the leak yet\\r\\nundiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that now taking\\r\\nsome alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the nearest\\r\\nharbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and repaired.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThough no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance\\r\\nfavoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way,\\r\\nbecause his pumps were of the best, and being periodically relieved at\\r\\nthem, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the ship free;\\r\\nnever mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well nigh the\\r\\nwhole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes, the\\r\\nTown-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port\\r\\nwithout the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been for the\\r\\nbrutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the bitterly\\r\\nprovoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from Buffalo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Lakeman!\\u2014Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is\\r\\nBuffalo?\\u2019 said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOn the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but\\u2014I crave your\\r\\ncourtesy\\u2014may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,\\r\\ngentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as\\r\\nlarge and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far\\r\\nManilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet\\r\\nbeen nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly\\r\\nconnected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,\\r\\nthose grand fresh-water seas of ours,\\u2014Erie, and Ontario, and Huron,\\r\\nand Superior, and Michigan,\\u2014possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with\\r\\nmany of the ocean\\u2019s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties\\r\\nof races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic\\r\\nisles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by\\r\\ntwo great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long\\r\\nmaritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the\\r\\nEast, dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by\\r\\nbatteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they have\\r\\nheard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they yield\\r\\ntheir beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash from out\\r\\ntheir peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient\\r\\nand unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines\\r\\nof kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild Afric\\r\\nbeasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes\\r\\nto Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and\\r\\nCleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the\\r\\nfull-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,\\r\\nand the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as\\r\\ndireful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks are,\\r\\nfor out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full many\\r\\na midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen, though\\r\\nan inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean nurtured;\\r\\nas much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney, though in his\\r\\ninfancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket beach, to nurse\\r\\nat his maternal sea; though in after life he had long followed our\\r\\naustere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was he quite as\\r\\nvengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman, fresh\\r\\nfrom the latitudes of buck-horn handled bowie-knives. Yet was this\\r\\nNantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this Lakeman, a\\r\\nmariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by inflexible\\r\\nfirmness, only tempered by that common decency of human recognition\\r\\nwhich is the meanest slave\\u2019s right; thus treated, this Steelkilt had\\r\\nlong been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he had proved\\r\\nso thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and Steelkilt\\u2014but,\\r\\ngentlemen, you shall hear.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing\\r\\nher prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho\\u2019s leak seemed again\\r\\nincreasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\\r\\nevery day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our\\r\\nAtlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole\\r\\nway across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the officer of\\r\\nthe deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the probability\\r\\nwould be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it, on\\r\\naccount of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom. Nor in the\\r\\nsolitary and savage seas far from you to the westward, gentlemen, is it\\r\\naltogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pump-handles in\\r\\nfull chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie\\r\\nalong a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat\\r\\nis afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of\\r\\nthe way part of those waters, some really landless latitude, that her\\r\\ncaptain begins to feel a little anxious.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMuch this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak\\r\\nwas found gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern\\r\\nmanifested by several of her company; especially by Radney the mate.\\r\\nHe commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and\\r\\nevery way expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was\\r\\nas little of a coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous\\r\\napprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking\\r\\ncreature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen.\\r\\nTherefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship,\\r\\nsome of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a\\r\\npart owner in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps,\\r\\nthere was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them,\\r\\nas they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling\\r\\nclear water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen\\u2014that bubbling\\r\\nfrom the pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady\\r\\nspouts at the lee scupper-holes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional\\r\\nworld of ours\\u2014watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in\\r\\ncommand over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly\\r\\nhis superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man\\r\\nhe conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have\\r\\na chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern\\u2019s tower, and\\r\\nmake a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,\\r\\ngentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\\r\\nhead like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings\\r\\nof your last viceroy\\u2019s snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and\\r\\na soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he\\r\\nbeen born son to Charlemagne\\u2019s father. But Radney, the mate, was ugly\\r\\nas a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious. He did not love\\r\\nSteelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEspying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the\\r\\nrest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with\\r\\nhis gay banterings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Aye, aye, my merry lads, it\\u2019s a lively leak this; hold a\\r\\ncannikin, one of ye, and let\\u2019s have a taste. By the Lord, it\\u2019s worth\\r\\nbottling! I tell ye what, men, old Rad\\u2019s investment must go for it!\\r\\nhe had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is,\\r\\nboys, that sword-fish only began the job; he\\u2019s come back again with a\\r\\ngang of ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the\\r\\nwhole posse of \\u2018em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the\\r\\nbottom; making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I\\u2019d\\r\\ntell him to jump overboard and scatter \\u2018em. They\\u2019re playing\\r\\nthe devil with his estate, I can tell him. But he\\u2019s a simple old\\r\\nsoul,\\u2014Rad, and a beauty too. Boys, they say the rest of his property\\r\\nis invested in looking-glasses. I wonder if he\\u2019d give a poor devil\\r\\nlike me the model of his nose.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Damn your eyes! what\\u2019s that pump stopping for?\\u2019 roared Radney,\\r\\npretending not to have heard the sailors\\u2019 talk. \\u2018Thunder away at\\r\\nit!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Aye, aye, sir,\\u2019 said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. \\u2018Lively,\\r\\nboys, lively, now!\\u2019 And with that the pump clanged like fifty\\r\\nfire-engines; the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that\\r\\npeculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest\\r\\ntension of life\\u2019s utmost energies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQuitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman\\r\\nwent forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\\r\\nfiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\\r\\nbrow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\\r\\nto meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\\r\\nnot; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\\r\\ncommanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\\r\\nshovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig\\r\\nto run at large.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow, gentlemen, sweeping a ship\\u2019s deck at sea is a piece of\\r\\nhousehold work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended\\r\\nto every evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships\\r\\nactually foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility\\r\\nof sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of\\r\\nwhom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But\\r\\nin all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the\\r\\nboys, if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the\\r\\nTown-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and\\r\\nbeing the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly\\r\\nassigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have\\r\\nbeen freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical\\r\\nduties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these\\r\\nparticulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood\\r\\nbetween the two men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost\\r\\nas plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had\\r\\nspat in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\\r\\nunderstand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully\\r\\ncomprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for\\r\\na moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate\\u2019s malignant\\r\\neye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the\\r\\nslow-match silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively\\r\\nsaw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the\\r\\ndeeper passionateness in any already ireful being\\u2014a repugnance most\\r\\nfelt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved\\u2014this\\r\\nnameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTherefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\\r\\nexhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\\r\\nthe deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without\\r\\nat all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary\\r\\nsweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or\\r\\nnothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most\\r\\ndomineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\\r\\ncommand; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\\r\\nuplifted cooper\\u2019s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near\\r\\nby.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHeated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps,\\r\\nfor all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\\r\\ncould but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\\r\\nsmothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\\r\\ndoggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\\r\\nhammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\\r\\nhis bidding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSteelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\\r\\nfollowed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his\\r\\nintention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not\\r\\nthe slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his\\r\\ntwisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to\\r\\nno purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;\\r\\nwhen, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had\\r\\nnow forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on\\r\\nthe hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look\\r\\nto yourself.\\u2019 But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him,\\r\\nwhere the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch\\r\\nof his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\\r\\nRetreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\\r\\nwith the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching\\r\\nhis right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\\r\\npersecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\\r\\nmurder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\\r\\nby the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\\r\\nthe lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch\\r\\nspouting blood like a whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEre the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays\\r\\nleading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their\\r\\nmastheads. They were both Canallers.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Canallers!\\u2019 cried Don Pedro. \\u2018We have seen many whale-ships\\r\\nin our harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what\\r\\nare they?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.\\r\\nYou must have heard of it.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and\\r\\nhereditary land, we know but little of your vigorous North.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha\\u2019s very fine; and\\r\\nere proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such\\r\\ninformation may throw side-light upon my story.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFor three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire\\r\\nbreadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and\\r\\nmost thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and\\r\\naffluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room\\r\\nand bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman\\r\\narches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or\\r\\nbroken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk\\r\\ncounties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires\\r\\nstand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly\\r\\ncorrupt and often lawless life. There\\u2019s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;\\r\\nthere howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;\\r\\nunder the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.\\r\\nFor by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan\\r\\nfreebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so\\r\\nsinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Is that a friar passing?\\u2019 said Don Pedro, looking downwards into\\r\\nthe crowded plazza, with humorous concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella\\u2019s Inquisition wanes\\r\\nin Lima,\\u2019 laughed Don Sebastian. \\u2018Proceed, Senor.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018A moment! Pardon!\\u2019 cried another of the company. \\u2018In the name\\r\\nof all us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we\\r\\nhave by no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present\\r\\nLima for distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and\\r\\nlook surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast\\u2014\\u201cCorrupt\\r\\nas Lima.\\u201d It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful\\r\\nthan billiard-tables, and for ever open\\u2014and \\u201cCorrupt as Lima.\\u201d So,\\r\\ntoo, Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist,\\r\\nSt. Mark!\\u2014St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now,\\r\\nyou pour out again.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFreely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would\\r\\nmake a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is\\r\\nhe. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed,\\r\\nflowery Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked\\r\\nCleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,\\r\\nall this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller\\r\\nso proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his grand\\r\\nfeatures. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages through\\r\\nwhich he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not unshunned\\r\\nin cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received good turns\\r\\nfrom one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would fain be not\\r\\nungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming qualities of your\\r\\nman of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm to back a poor\\r\\nstranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In sum, gentlemen,\\r\\nwhat the wildness of this canal life is, is emphatically evinced by\\r\\nthis; that our wild whale-fishery contains so many of its most finished\\r\\ngraduates, and that scarce any race of mankind, except Sydney men, are\\r\\nso much distrusted by our whaling captains. Nor does it at all diminish\\r\\nthe curiousness of this matter, that to many thousands of our rural boys\\r\\nand young men born along its line, the probationary life of the Grand\\r\\nCanal furnishes the sole transition between quietly reaping in a\\r\\nChristian corn-field, and recklessly ploughing the waters of the most\\r\\nbarbaric seas.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018I see! I see!\\u2019 impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his\\r\\nchicha upon his silvery ruffles. \\u2018No need to travel! The world\\u2019s one\\r\\nLima. I had thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations\\r\\nwere cold and holy as the hills.\\u2014But the story.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly\\r\\nhad he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the\\r\\nfour harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down the\\r\\nropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the uproar, and\\r\\nsought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle. Others of the\\r\\nsailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted turmoil ensued;\\r\\nwhile standing out of harm\\u2019s way, the valiant captain danced up and\\r\\ndown with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to manhandle that\\r\\natrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the quarter-deck. At\\r\\nintervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion,\\r\\nand prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to prick out the\\r\\nobject of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his desperadoes were too\\r\\nmuch for them all; they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck, where,\\r\\nhastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with\\r\\nthe windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves behind the\\r\\nbarricade.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Come out of that, ye pirates!\\u2019 roared the captain, now menacing\\r\\nthem with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward.\\r\\n\\u2018Come out of that, ye cut-throats!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSteelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down\\r\\nthere, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain\\r\\nto understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt\\u2019s) death would be the\\r\\nsignal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his\\r\\nheart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted,\\r\\nbut still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?\\u2019 demanded their\\r\\nringleader.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Turn to! turn to!\\u2014I make no promise;\\u2014to your duty! Do you want\\r\\nto sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!\\u2019 and\\r\\nhe once more raised a pistol.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Sink the ship?\\u2019 cried Steelkilt. \\u2018Aye, let her sink. Not a man\\r\\nof us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.\\r\\nWhat say ye, men?\\u2019 turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their\\r\\nresponse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his\\r\\neye on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:\\u2014\\u2018It\\u2019s\\r\\nnot our fault; we didn\\u2019t want it; I told him to take his hammer away;\\r\\nit was boy\\u2019s business; he might have known me before this; I told him\\r\\nnot to prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against\\r\\nhis cursed jaw; ain\\u2019t those mincing knives down in the forecastle\\r\\nthere, men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God,\\r\\nlook to yourself; say the word; don\\u2019t be a fool; forget it all; we\\r\\nare ready to turn to; treat us decently, and we\\u2019re your men; but we\\r\\nwon\\u2019t be flogged.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Look ye, now,\\u2019 cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards\\r\\nhim, \\u2018there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have\\r\\nshipped for the cruise, d\\u2019ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can\\r\\nclaim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don\\u2019t want a\\r\\nrow; it\\u2019s not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to\\r\\nwork, but we won\\u2019t be flogged.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Turn to!\\u2019 roared the Captain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSteelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:\\u2014\\u2018I tell you\\r\\nwhat it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a\\r\\nshabby rascal, we won\\u2019t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack\\r\\nus; but till you say the word about not flogging us, we don\\u2019t do a\\r\\nhand\\u2019s turn.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I\\u2019ll keep ye there\\r\\ntill ye\\u2019re sick of it. Down ye go.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Shall we?\\u2019 cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were\\r\\nagainst it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him\\r\\ndown into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a\\r\\ncave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAs the Lakeman\\u2019s bare head was just level with the planks, the\\r\\nCaptain and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the\\r\\nslide of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly\\r\\ncalled for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the\\r\\ncompanionway.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered something\\r\\ndown the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them\\u2014ten in\\r\\nnumber\\u2014leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had remained\\r\\nneutral.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward\\r\\nand aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway;\\r\\nat which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after\\r\\nbreaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed\\r\\nin peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the\\r\\npumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night\\r\\ndismally resounded through the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAt sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,\\r\\nsummoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water\\r\\nwas then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were\\r\\ntossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,\\r\\nthe Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three days\\r\\nthis was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling, and\\r\\nthen a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered; and\\r\\nsuddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were ready\\r\\nto turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet, united\\r\\nperhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained them to\\r\\nsurrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain reiterated his\\r\\ndemand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to\\r\\nstop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged. On the fifth\\r\\nmorning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the\\r\\ndesperate arms below that sought to restrain them. Only three were left.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Better turn to, now?\\u2019 said the Captain with a heartless jeer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Shut us up again, will ye!\\u2019 cried Steelkilt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Oh certainly,\\u2019 said the Captain, and the key clicked.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of\\r\\nseven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had\\r\\nlast hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black\\r\\nas the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to the\\r\\ntwo Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst out of\\r\\ntheir hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with their\\r\\nkeen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a handle\\r\\nat each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if by any\\r\\ndevilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For himself, he\\r\\nwould do this, he said, whether they joined him or not. That was the\\r\\nlast night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met with no\\r\\nopposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were ready for\\r\\nthat, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a surrender.\\r\\nAnd what was more, they each insisted upon being the first man on deck,\\r\\nwhen the time to make the rush should come. But to this their leader as\\r\\nfiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself; particularly as\\r\\nhis two comrades would not yield, the one to the other, in the matter;\\r\\nand both of them could not be first, for the ladder would but admit one\\r\\nman at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play of these miscreants\\r\\nmust come out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cUpon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own\\r\\nseparate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece\\r\\nof treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be\\r\\nthe first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and\\r\\nthereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit.\\r\\nBut when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to\\r\\nthe last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of villany, mixed\\r\\ntheir before secret treacheries together; and when their leader\\r\\nfell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in three\\r\\nsentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with cords;\\r\\nand shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he\\r\\nand all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a\\r\\nfew minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still\\r\\nstruggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious\\r\\nallies, who at once claimed the honour of securing a man who had been\\r\\nfully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along\\r\\nthe deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the\\r\\nmizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till\\r\\nmorning. \\u2018Damn ye,\\u2019 cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before\\r\\nthem, \\u2018the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAt sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had\\r\\nrebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the\\r\\nformer that he had a good mind to flog them all round\\u2014thought, upon\\r\\nthe whole, he would do so\\u2014he ought to\\u2014justice demanded it; but for\\r\\nthe present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go\\r\\nwith a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018But as for you, ye carrion rogues,\\u2019 turning to the three men\\r\\nin the rigging\\u2014\\u2018for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;\\u2019\\r\\nand, seizing a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of\\r\\nthe two traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their\\r\\nheads sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018My wrist is sprained with ye!\\u2019 he cried, at last; \\u2018but there\\r\\nis still rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn\\u2019t give\\r\\nup. Take that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for\\r\\nhimself.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFor a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his\\r\\ncramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a sort\\r\\nof hiss, \\u2018What I say is this\\u2014and mind it well\\u2014if you flog me, I\\r\\nmurder you!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me\\u2019\\u2014and the Captain drew\\r\\noff with the rope to strike.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Best not,\\u2019 hissed the Lakeman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018But I must,\\u2019\\u2014and the rope was once more drawn back for the\\r\\nstroke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSteelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the\\r\\nCaptain; who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the\\r\\ndeck rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his\\r\\nrope, said, \\u2018I won\\u2019t do it\\u2014let him go\\u2014cut him down: d\\u2019ye\\r\\nhear?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale\\r\\nman, with a bandaged head, arrested them\\u2014Radney the chief mate. Ever\\r\\nsince the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the\\r\\ntumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the whole\\r\\nscene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly speak;\\r\\nbut mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the\\r\\ncaptain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced to his\\r\\npinioned foe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018You are a coward!\\u2019 hissed the Lakeman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018So I am, but take that.\\u2019 The mate was in the very act of\\r\\nstriking, when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and\\r\\nthen pausing no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt\\u2019s threat,\\r\\nwhatever that might have been. The three men were then cut down, all\\r\\nhands were turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron\\r\\npumps clanged as before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cJust after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor\\r\\nwas heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,\\r\\nbesieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.\\r\\nEntreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own\\r\\ninstance they were put down in the ship\\u2019s run for salvation. Still,\\r\\nno sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,\\r\\nthat mainly at Steelkilt\\u2019s instigation, they had resolved to maintain\\r\\nthe strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the\\r\\nship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the\\r\\nspeediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing\\u2014namely,\\r\\nnot to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,\\r\\nspite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still\\r\\nmaintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to\\r\\nlower for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the\\r\\ncruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his\\r\\nberth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the\\r\\nvital jaw of the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of\\r\\npassiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till all\\r\\nwas over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who\\r\\nhad stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney the chief\\r\\nmate\\u2019s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than\\r\\nhalf way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he insisted,\\r\\nagainst the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the head\\r\\nof his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other circumstances,\\r\\nSteelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDuring the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the\\r\\nbulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of\\r\\nthe boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship\\u2019s side.\\r\\nIn this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a\\r\\nconsiderable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between\\r\\nthis was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his next\\r\\ntrick at the helm would come round at two o\\u2019clock, in the morning of\\r\\nthe third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his leisure,\\r\\nhe employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his\\r\\nwatches below.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018What are you making there?\\u2019 said a shipmate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018What do you think? what does it look like?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Like a lanyard for your bag; but it\\u2019s an odd one, seems to\\r\\nme.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Yes, rather oddish,\\u2019 said the Lakeman, holding it at arm\\u2019s\\r\\nlength before him; \\u2018but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven\\u2019t\\r\\nenough twine,\\u2014have you any?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut there was none in the forecastle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Then I must get some from old Rad;\\u2019 and he rose to go aft.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018You don\\u2019t mean to go a begging to him!\\u2019 said a sailor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Why not? Do you think he won\\u2019t do me a turn, when it\\u2019s to help\\r\\nhimself in the end, shipmate?\\u2019 and going to the mate, he looked at him\\r\\nquietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given\\r\\nhim\\u2014neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night\\r\\nan iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the\\r\\nLakeman\\u2019s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his\\r\\nhammock for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent\\r\\nhelm\\u2014nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready\\r\\ndug to the seaman\\u2019s hand\\u2014that fatal hour was then to come; and in\\r\\nthe fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and\\r\\nstretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody\\r\\ndeed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the\\r\\navenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in\\r\\nto take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have\\r\\ndone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second\\r\\nday, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe man,\\r\\ndrawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, \\u2018There she\\r\\nrolls! there she rolls!\\u2019 Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Moby Dick!\\u2019 cried Don Sebastian; \\u2018St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but\\r\\ndo whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster,\\r\\nDon;\\u2014but that would be too long a story.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018How? how?\\u2019 cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Nay, Dons, Dons\\u2014nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get\\r\\nmore into the air, Sirs.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018The chicha! the chicha!\\u2019 cried Don Pedro; \\u2018our vigorous friend\\r\\nlooks faint;\\u2014fill up his empty glass!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.\\u2014Now, gentlemen,\\r\\nso suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the\\r\\nship\\u2014forgetful of the compact among the crew\\u2014in the excitement of\\r\\nthe moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted\\r\\nhis voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been\\r\\nplainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.\\r\\n\\u2018The White Whale\\u2014the White Whale!\\u2019 was the cry from captain,\\r\\nmates, and harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all\\r\\nanxious to capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew\\r\\neyed askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky\\r\\nmass, that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened\\r\\nlike a living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange\\r\\nfatality pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped\\r\\nout before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman\\r\\nof the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,\\r\\nwhile Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or slacken\\r\\nthe line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats were\\r\\nlowered, the mate\\u2019s got the start; and none howled more fiercely with\\r\\ndelight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a stiff\\r\\npull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney sprang to\\r\\nthe bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat. And now his\\r\\nbandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale\\u2019s topmost back. Nothing\\r\\nloath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding foam that\\r\\nblent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck as\\r\\nagainst a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing\\r\\nmate. That instant, as he fell on the whale\\u2019s slippery back, the boat\\r\\nrighted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over\\r\\ninto the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through\\r\\nthe spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly\\r\\nseeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale\\r\\nrushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws;\\r\\nand rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMeantime, at the first tap of the boat\\u2019s bottom, the Lakeman had\\r\\nslackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly\\r\\nlooking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,\\r\\ndownward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He\\r\\ncut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose\\r\\nagain, with some tatters of Radney\\u2019s red woollen shirt, caught in the\\r\\nteeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the\\r\\nwhale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIn good time, the Town-Ho reached her port\\u2014a savage, solitary\\r\\nplace\\u2014where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the\\r\\nLakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted\\r\\namong the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double\\r\\nwar-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe ship\\u2019s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain\\r\\ncalled upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of\\r\\nheaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance\\r\\nover their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated,\\r\\nboth by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they\\r\\nunderwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in\\r\\nsuch a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with\\r\\nthem in so heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he\\r\\nanchored the ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his\\r\\ntwo cannon from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning\\r\\nthe Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man\\r\\nwith him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight\\r\\nbefore the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a\\r\\nreinforcement to his crew.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOn the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which\\r\\nseemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from it;\\r\\nbut the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of Steelkilt\\r\\nhailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The captain\\r\\npresented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked war-canoes,\\r\\nthe Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the pistol so\\r\\nmuch as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and foam.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018What do you want of me?\\u2019 cried the captain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?\\u2019 demanded\\r\\nSteelkilt; \\u2018no lies.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018I am bound to Tahiti for more men.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Very good. Let me board you a moment\\u2014I come in peace.\\u2019 With\\r\\nthat he leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the\\r\\ngunwale, stood face to face with the captain.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me.\\r\\nAs soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder\\r\\nisland, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightning strike\\r\\nme!\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018A pretty scholar,\\u2019 laughed the Lakeman. \\u2018Adios, Senor!\\u2019 and\\r\\nleaping into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWatching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the\\r\\nroots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due time\\r\\narrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck befriended\\r\\nhim; two ships were about to sail for France, and were providentially\\r\\nin want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed. They\\r\\nembarked; and so for ever got the start of their former captain, had he\\r\\nbeen at all minded to work them legal retribution.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSome ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,\\r\\nand the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized\\r\\nTahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small\\r\\nnative schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all\\r\\nright there, again resumed his cruisings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of\\r\\nNantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses\\r\\nto give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that\\r\\ndestroyed him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Are you through?\\u2019 said Don Sebastian, quietly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018I am, Don.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own\\r\\nconvictions, this your story is in substance really true? It is so\\r\\npassing wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear\\r\\nwith me if I seem to press.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don\\r\\nSebastian\\u2019s suit,\\u2019 cried the company, with exceeding interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,\\r\\ngentlemen?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Nay,\\u2019 said Don Sebastian; \\u2018but I know a worthy priest near\\r\\nby, who will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well\\r\\nadvised? this may grow too serious.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Though there are no Auto-da-Fe\\u2019s in Lima now,\\u2019 said one of\\r\\nthe company to another; \\u2018I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the\\r\\narchiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no\\r\\nneed of this.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg\\r\\nthat you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists\\r\\nyou can.\\u2019\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,\\u2019 said Don\\r\\nSebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the\\r\\nlight, and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018So help me Heaven, and on my honour the story I have told ye,\\r\\ngentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be\\r\\ntrue; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I have\\r\\nseen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.\\u2019\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nI shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,\\r\\nsomething like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\\r\\neye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\\r\\nalongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\\r\\nIt may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those\\r\\ncurious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\\r\\nconfidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\\r\\nworld right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\\r\\nwrong.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\\r\\nbe found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\\r\\never since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\\r\\npanellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\\r\\nmedallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\\r\\nchain-armor like Saladin\\u2019s, and a helmeted head like St. George\\u2019s;\\r\\never since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed,\\r\\nnot only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\\r\\npresentations of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting\\r\\nto be the whale\\u2019s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of\\r\\nElephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless\\r\\nsculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every\\r\\nconceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them\\r\\nactually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble\\r\\nprofession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The\\r\\nHindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,\\r\\ndepicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly\\r\\nknown as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and\\r\\nhalf whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small\\r\\nsection of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an\\r\\nanaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale\\u2019s majestic flukes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian\\r\\npainter\\u2019s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than\\r\\nthe antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido\\u2019s picture of Perseus rescuing\\r\\nAndromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model\\r\\nof such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting\\r\\nthe same scene in his own \\u201cPerseus Descending,\\u201d make out one whit\\r\\nbetter. The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the\\r\\nsurface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah\\r\\non its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are\\r\\nrolling, might be taken for the Traitors\\u2019 Gate leading from the Thames\\r\\nby water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old\\r\\nScotch Sibbald, and Jonah\\u2019s whale, as depicted in the prints of old\\r\\nBibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for\\r\\nthe book-binder\\u2019s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of\\r\\na descending anchor\\u2014as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages\\r\\nof many books both old and new\\u2014that is a very picturesque but purely\\r\\nfabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique\\r\\nvases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call\\r\\nthis book-binder\\u2019s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so\\r\\nintended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by\\r\\nan old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the\\r\\nRevival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively\\r\\nlate period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the\\r\\nLeviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will\\r\\nat times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner\\r\\nof spouts, jets d\\u2019eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden,\\r\\ncome bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the\\r\\noriginal edition of the \\u201cAdvancement of Learning\\u201d you will find some\\r\\ncurious whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\\r\\npictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\\r\\nby those who know. In old Harris\\u2019s collection of voyages there are\\r\\nsome plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\\r\\nentitled \\u201cA Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\\r\\nWhale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\\u201d In one of those plates\\r\\nthe whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among\\r\\nice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another\\r\\nplate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with\\r\\nperpendicular flukes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett,\\r\\na Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \\u201cA Voyage round Cape Horn\\r\\ninto the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale\\r\\nFisheries.\\u201d In this book is an outline purporting to be a \\u201cPicture\\r\\nof a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the\\r\\ncoast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.\\u201d I doubt not the\\r\\ncaptain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines.\\r\\nTo mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which\\r\\napplied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm\\r\\nwhale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet\\r\\nlong. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out\\r\\nof that eye!\\r\\n\\r\\nNor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\\r\\nthe benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\\r\\nmistake. Look at that popular work \\u201cGoldsmith\\u2019s Animated Nature.\\u201d\\r\\nIn the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged\\r\\n\\u201cwhale\\u201d and a \\u201cnarwhale.\\u201d I do not wish to seem inelegant, but\\r\\nthis unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for\\r\\nthe narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this\\r\\nnineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon\\r\\nany intelligent public of schoolboys.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\\r\\nnaturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\\r\\nseveral pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\\r\\nare not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\\r\\nwhale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\\r\\nexperienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\\r\\ncounterpart in nature.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\\r\\nreserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\\r\\nBaron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\\r\\ngives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\\r\\npicture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\\r\\nretreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier\\u2019s Sperm Whale is\\r\\nnot a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit\\r\\nof a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\\r\\npicture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\\r\\nin the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\\r\\nis, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil\\r\\nthose Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for the sign-painters\\u2019 whales seen in the streets hanging over the\\r\\nshops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\\r\\nRichard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting\\r\\non three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners:\\r\\ntheir deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\\r\\nsurprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have\\r\\nbeen taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\\r\\ndrawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\\r\\nthe noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\\r\\nThough elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan\\r\\nhas never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale,\\r\\nin his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in\\r\\nunfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight,\\r\\nlike a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a\\r\\nthing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the\\r\\nair, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not\\r\\nto speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young\\r\\nsucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the\\r\\ncase of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship\\u2019s deck,\\r\\nsuch is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him,\\r\\nthat his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\\r\\nwhale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all.\\r\\nFor it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that\\r\\nhis skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy\\r\\nBentham\\u2019s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of\\r\\none of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed\\r\\nutilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy\\u2019s other leading personal\\r\\ncharacteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any\\r\\nleviathan\\u2019s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the\\r\\nmere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested\\r\\nand padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly\\r\\nenvelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as\\r\\nin some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very\\r\\ncuriously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly\\r\\nanswer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin\\r\\nhas four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little\\r\\nfinger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering,\\r\\nas the human fingers in an artificial covering. \\u201cHowever recklessly\\r\\nthe whale may sometimes serve us,\\u201d said humorous Stubb one day, \\u201che\\r\\ncan never be truly said to handle us without mittens.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs\\r\\nconclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world\\r\\nwhich must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit\\r\\nthe mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very\\r\\nconsiderable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding\\r\\nout precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in\\r\\nwhich you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is\\r\\nby going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of\\r\\nbeing eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you had\\r\\nbest not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True\\r\\nPictures of Whaling Scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly\\r\\ntempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of\\r\\nthem which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,\\r\\nespecially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass\\r\\nthat matter by.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;\\r\\nColnett\\u2019s, Huggins\\u2019s, Frederick Cuvier\\u2019s, and Beale\\u2019s. In the\\r\\nprevious chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins\\u2019s\\r\\nis far better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale\\u2019s is the best.\\r\\nAll Beale\\u2019s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle\\r\\nfigure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his\\r\\nsecond chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though\\r\\nno doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men,\\r\\nis admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the\\r\\nSperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;\\r\\nbut they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they\\r\\nare drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has\\r\\nbut one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency, because\\r\\nit is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you can derive\\r\\nanything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living\\r\\nhunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details\\r\\nnot the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to\\r\\nbe anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed,\\r\\nand taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent\\r\\nattacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble\\r\\nSperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath\\r\\nthe boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air\\r\\nupon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of\\r\\nthe boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the\\r\\nmonster\\u2019s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single\\r\\nincomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the\\r\\nincensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if\\r\\nfrom a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and\\r\\ntrue. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden\\r\\npoles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the\\r\\nswimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions\\r\\nof affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down\\r\\nupon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical details\\r\\nof this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I could not\\r\\ndraw so good a one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside\\r\\nthe barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his black\\r\\nweedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the Patagonian\\r\\ncliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so\\r\\nabounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave\\r\\nsupper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the\\r\\nsmall crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the\\r\\nRight Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while\\r\\nthe thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of\\r\\ntumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock\\r\\nin the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean\\r\\nsteamer. Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in\\r\\nadmirable artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the\\r\\ndrooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of\\r\\na dead whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily\\r\\nhanging from the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he\\r\\nwas either practically conversant with his subject, or else marvellously\\r\\ntutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the lads for\\r\\npainting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe, and\\r\\nwhere will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion\\r\\non canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the beholder\\r\\nfights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great battles of\\r\\nFrance; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern Lights, and the\\r\\nsuccessive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a charge of crowned\\r\\ncentaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery, are these sea\\r\\nbattle-pieces of Garnery.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of\\r\\nthings seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings\\r\\nthey have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England\\u2019s\\r\\nexperience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the\\r\\nAmericans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only\\r\\nfinished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of\\r\\nthe whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale\\r\\ndraughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline\\r\\nof things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so far as\\r\\npicturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to sketching\\r\\nthe profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned Right\\r\\nwhaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland whale,\\r\\nand three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises, treats\\r\\nus to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks, chopping knives,\\r\\nand grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a Leuwenhoeck\\r\\nsubmits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six fac-similes of\\r\\nmagnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement to the excellent\\r\\nvoyager (I honour him for a veteran), but in so important a matter it\\r\\nwas certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a\\r\\nsworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of the Peace.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other\\r\\nFrench engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself\\r\\n\\u201cH. Durand.\\u201d One of them, though not precisely adapted to our\\r\\npresent purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It\\r\\nis a quiet noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler\\r\\nanchored, inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the\\r\\nloosened sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the\\r\\nbackground, both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is\\r\\nvery fine, when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy\\r\\nfishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other\\r\\nengraving is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open\\r\\nsea, and in the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale\\r\\nalongside; the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the\\r\\nmonster as if to a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this\\r\\nscene of activity, is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The\\r\\nharpoons and lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting\\r\\nthe mast in its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little\\r\\ncraft stands half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the\\r\\nship, the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like\\r\\nthe smoke over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud,\\r\\nrising up with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the\\r\\nactivity of the excited seamen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in\\r\\nStone; in Mountains; in Stars.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a\\r\\ncrippled beggar (or kedger, as the sailors say) holding a painted board\\r\\nbefore him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg.\\r\\nThere are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed\\r\\nto contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is being\\r\\ncrunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years,\\r\\nthey tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that\\r\\nstump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification has\\r\\nnow come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in\\r\\nWapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you\\r\\nwill find in the western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on\\r\\nthat stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with\\r\\ndowncast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and\\r\\nSag Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and\\r\\nwhaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm Whale-teeth,\\r\\nor ladies\\u2019 busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and other\\r\\nlike skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous little\\r\\ningenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material,\\r\\nin their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little boxes\\r\\nof dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the\\r\\nskrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their\\r\\njack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,\\r\\nthey will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner\\u2019s\\r\\nfancy.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man\\r\\nto that condition in which God placed him, i.e. what is called savagery.\\r\\nYour true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I myself am a\\r\\nsavage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the Cannibals; and ready\\r\\nat any moment to rebel against him.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic\\r\\nhours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian\\r\\nwar-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of\\r\\ncarving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.\\r\\nFor, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark\\u2019s tooth, that\\r\\nmiraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has\\r\\ncost steady years of steady application.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the\\r\\nsame marvellous patience, and with the same single shark\\u2019s tooth, of\\r\\nhis one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not\\r\\nquite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as\\r\\nthe Greek savage, Achilles\\u2019s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and\\r\\nsuggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert\\r\\nDurer.\\r\\n\\r\\nWooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of\\r\\nthe noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the forecastles\\r\\nof American whalers. Some of them are done with much accuracy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung\\r\\nby the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is\\r\\nsleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking\\r\\nwhales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some\\r\\nold-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for\\r\\nweather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all\\r\\nintents and purposes so labelled with \\u201cHands off!\\u201d you cannot\\r\\nexamine them closely enough to decide upon their merit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken\\r\\ncliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the\\r\\nplain, you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the\\r\\nLeviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against\\r\\nthem in a surf of green surges.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually\\r\\ngirdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from some lucky\\r\\npoint of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of\\r\\nwhales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be a thorough\\r\\nwhaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you wish\\r\\nto return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the exact\\r\\nintersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point, else\\r\\nso chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your precise,\\r\\nprevious stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery; like the\\r\\nSoloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once high-ruffed\\r\\nMendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out\\r\\ngreat whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as\\r\\nwhen long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies\\r\\nlocked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased\\r\\nLeviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright\\r\\npoints that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent Antarctic\\r\\nskies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase against the\\r\\nstarry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and the Flying\\r\\nFish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a frigate\\u2019s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons\\r\\nfor spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to\\r\\nsee whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie\\r\\nencamped beyond my mortal sight!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 58. Brit.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows\\r\\nof brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale\\r\\nlargely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that we\\r\\nseemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from\\r\\nthe attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly\\r\\nswam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that\\r\\nwondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated\\r\\nfrom the water that escaped at the lip.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance\\r\\ntheir scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these\\r\\nmonsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving\\r\\nbehind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*That part of the sea known among whalemen as the \\u201cBrazil Banks\\u201d\\r\\ndoes not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of\\r\\nthere being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable\\r\\nmeadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually\\r\\nfloating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all\\r\\nreminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when they\\r\\npaused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms looked\\r\\nmore like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in the\\r\\ngreat hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will\\r\\nsometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them\\r\\nto be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil; even\\r\\nso, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species of the\\r\\nleviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their immense\\r\\nmagnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses\\r\\nof overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with the same sort\\r\\nof life that lives in a dog or a horse.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the\\r\\ndeep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though\\r\\nsome old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are\\r\\nof their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of\\r\\nthe thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for\\r\\nexample, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to\\r\\nthe sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any\\r\\ngeneric respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the\\r\\nseas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and\\r\\nrepelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,\\r\\nso that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his\\r\\none superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific\\r\\nof all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen\\r\\ntens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;\\r\\nthough but a moment\\u2019s consideration will teach, that however baby man\\r\\nmay brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering\\r\\nfuture, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,\\r\\nto the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize\\r\\nthe stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the\\r\\ncontinual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense\\r\\nof the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese\\r\\nvengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.\\r\\nThat same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships\\r\\nof last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah\\u2019s flood is not yet subsided;\\r\\ntwo thirds of the fair world it yet covers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a\\r\\nmiracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,\\r\\nwhen under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened\\r\\nand swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in\\r\\nprecisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it\\r\\nis also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who\\r\\nmurdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath\\r\\nspawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her\\r\\nown cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks,\\r\\nand leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships. No\\r\\nmercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting like a mad\\r\\nbattle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean overruns the\\r\\nglobe.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide\\r\\nunder water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden\\r\\nbeneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish\\r\\nbrilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the\\r\\ndainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more,\\r\\nthe universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each\\r\\nother, carrying on eternal war since the world began.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile\\r\\nearth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a\\r\\nstrange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean\\r\\nsurrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one insular\\r\\nTahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the horrors of the\\r\\nhalf known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that isle, thou canst\\r\\nnever return!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 59. Squid.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her\\r\\nway north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling\\r\\nher keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering\\r\\nmasts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a\\r\\nplain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,\\r\\nalluring jet would be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural\\r\\nspread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when\\r\\nthe long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid\\r\\nacross them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered\\r\\ntogether as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible\\r\\nsphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and\\r\\nhigher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before\\r\\nour prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening\\r\\nfor a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,\\r\\nand silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?\\r\\nthought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once\\r\\nmore, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,\\r\\nthe negro yelled out\\u2014\\u201cThere! there again! there she breaches! right\\r\\nahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the\\r\\nbees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on\\r\\nthe bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave\\r\\nhis orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction\\r\\nindicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had\\r\\ngradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the\\r\\nideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular\\r\\nwhale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed\\r\\nhim; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly\\r\\nperceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave\\r\\norders for lowering.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four boats were soon on the water; Ahab\\u2019s in advance, and all\\r\\nswiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with\\r\\noars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same\\r\\nspot where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for\\r\\nthe moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous\\r\\nphenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind.\\r\\nA vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing\\r\\ncream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms radiating\\r\\nfrom its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas, as\\r\\nif blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach. No perceptible\\r\\nface or front did it have; no conceivable token of either sensation or\\r\\ninstinct; but undulated there on the billows, an unearthly, formless,\\r\\nchance-like apparition of life.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still\\r\\ngazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice\\r\\nexclaimed\\u2014\\u201cAlmost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than\\r\\nto have seen thee, thou white ghost!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat was it, Sir?\\u201d said Flask.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,\\r\\nand returned to their ports to tell of it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;\\r\\nthe rest as silently following.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with\\r\\nthe sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it being\\r\\nso very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with\\r\\nportentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them\\r\\ndeclare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few\\r\\nof them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and\\r\\nform; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale\\r\\nhis only food. For though other species of whales find their food above\\r\\nwater, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the spermaceti\\r\\nwhale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface; and\\r\\nonly by inference is it that any one can tell of what, precisely, that\\r\\nfood consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will disgorge what\\r\\nare supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some of them thus\\r\\nexhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They fancy that\\r\\nthe monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to\\r\\nthe bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other species, is\\r\\nsupplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop\\r\\nPontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in\\r\\nwhich the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with\\r\\nsome other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond.\\r\\nBut much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he\\r\\nassigns it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious\\r\\ncreature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of cuttle-fish,\\r\\nto which, indeed, in certain external respects it would seem to belong,\\r\\nbut only as the Anak of the tribe.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 60. The Line.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as\\r\\nfor the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,\\r\\nI have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly\\r\\nvapoured with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary\\r\\nropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to\\r\\nthe rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the\\r\\nsailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary quantity\\r\\ntoo much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must\\r\\nbe subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general\\r\\nby no means adds to the rope\\u2019s durability or strength, however much it\\r\\nmay give it compactness and gloss.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost\\r\\nentirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not\\r\\nso durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and\\r\\nI will add (since there is an aesthetics in all things), is much more\\r\\nhandsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark\\r\\nfellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian\\r\\nto behold.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first\\r\\nsight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment\\r\\nits one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and\\r\\ntwenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal\\r\\nto three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures something\\r\\nover two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally\\r\\ncoiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but\\r\\nso as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded\\r\\n\\u201csheaves,\\u201d or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any\\r\\nhollow but the \\u201cheart,\\u201d or minute vertical tube formed at the axis\\r\\nof the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in\\r\\nrunning out, infallibly take somebody\\u2019s arm, leg, or entire body\\r\\noff, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some\\r\\nharpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,\\r\\ncarrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a\\r\\nblock towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all\\r\\npossible wrinkles and twists.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line\\r\\nbeing continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in this;\\r\\nbecause these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the\\r\\nboat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub, nearly\\r\\nthree feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky\\r\\nfreight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness; for\\r\\nthe bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up\\r\\na considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated\\r\\none. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub,\\r\\nthe boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great\\r\\nwedding-cake to present to the whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an\\r\\neye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the\\r\\ntub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.\\r\\nThis arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:\\r\\nIn order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a\\r\\nneighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as\\r\\nto threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the\\r\\nharpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug\\r\\nof ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the\\r\\nfirst boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This\\r\\narrangement is indispensable for common safety\\u2019s sake; for were the\\r\\nlower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the\\r\\nwhale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking\\r\\nminute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed\\r\\nboat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of\\r\\nthe sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is\\r\\ntaken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again\\r\\ncarried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon\\r\\nthe loom or handle of every man\\u2019s oar, so that it jogs against his\\r\\nwrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately\\r\\nsit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the\\r\\nextreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size\\r\\nof a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it\\r\\nhangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside\\r\\nthe boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being\\r\\ncoiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale\\r\\nstill a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp\\u2014the\\r\\nrope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to\\r\\nthat connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too\\r\\ntedious to detail.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,\\r\\ntwisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the\\r\\noarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid\\r\\neye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest\\r\\nsnakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal\\r\\nwoman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,\\r\\nand while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any\\r\\nunknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible\\r\\ncontortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus\\r\\ncircumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones\\r\\nto quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit\\u2014strange thing! what\\r\\ncannot habit accomplish?\\u2014Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better\\r\\njokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than\\r\\nyou will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when\\r\\nthus hung in hangman\\u2019s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais\\r\\nbefore King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of\\r\\ndeath, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for\\r\\nthose repeated whaling disasters\\u2014some few of which are casually\\r\\nchronicled\\u2014of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the\\r\\nline, and lost. For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in\\r\\nthe boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings\\r\\nof a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and\\r\\nwheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in the\\r\\nheart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and\\r\\nyou are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning;\\r\\nand only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of\\r\\nvolition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run\\r\\naway with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and\\r\\nprophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;\\r\\nfor, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and\\r\\ncontains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal\\r\\npowder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the\\r\\nline, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought\\r\\ninto actual play\\u2014this is a thing which carries more of true terror\\r\\nthan any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All\\r\\nmen live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their\\r\\nnecks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,\\r\\nthat mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.\\r\\nAnd if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would\\r\\nnot at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before\\r\\nyour evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to\\r\\nQueequeg it was quite a different object.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhen you see him \\u2018quid,\\u201d said the savage, honing his harpoon in\\r\\nthe bow of his hoisted boat, \\u201cthen you quick see him \\u2018parm whale.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special\\r\\nto engage them, the Pequod\\u2019s crew could hardly resist the spell of\\r\\nsleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean\\r\\nthrough which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively\\r\\nground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,\\r\\nflying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than\\r\\nthose off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders\\r\\nleaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed in\\r\\nwhat seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in that\\r\\ndreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of my\\r\\nbody; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will, long\\r\\nafter the power which first moved it is withdrawn.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the seamen\\r\\nat the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that at last\\r\\nall three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every swing\\r\\nthat we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman.\\r\\nThe waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the wide trance\\r\\nof the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my\\r\\nhands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved me;\\r\\nwith a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not forty\\r\\nfathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like the\\r\\ncapsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian hue,\\r\\nglistening in the sun\\u2019s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating in\\r\\nthe trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapoury\\r\\njet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm\\r\\nafternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck by some\\r\\nenchanter\\u2019s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once\\r\\nstarted into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from all parts\\r\\nof the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from aloft, shouted\\r\\nforth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted\\r\\nthe sparkling brine into the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cClear away the boats! Luff!\\u201d cried Ahab. And obeying his own order,\\r\\nhe dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and ere\\r\\nthe boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the leeward,\\r\\nbut with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples as he\\r\\nswam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed, Ahab gave\\r\\norders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak but in\\r\\nwhispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the boats,\\r\\nwe swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of the\\r\\nnoiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase, the\\r\\nmonster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air, and\\r\\nthen sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere go flukes!\\u201d was the cry, an announcement immediately followed\\r\\nby Stubb\\u2019s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a\\r\\nrespite was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had\\r\\nelapsed, the whale rose again, and being now in advance of the\\r\\nsmoker\\u2019s boat, and much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb\\r\\ncounted upon the honour of the capture. It was obvious, now, that\\r\\nthe whale had at length become aware of his pursuers. All silence of\\r\\ncautiousness was therefore no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and\\r\\noars came loudly into play. And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered\\r\\non his crew to the assault.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,\\r\\nhe was going \\u201chead out\\u201d; that part obliquely projecting from the mad\\r\\nyeast which he brewed.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the\\r\\nentire interior of the sperm whale\\u2019s enormous head consists. Though\\r\\napparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about\\r\\nhim. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does\\r\\nso when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the\\r\\nupper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water\\r\\nformation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he\\r\\nthereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish\\r\\ngalliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStart her, start her, my men! Don\\u2019t hurry yourselves; take plenty\\r\\nof time\\u2014but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that\\u2019s all,\\u201d\\r\\ncried Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. \\u201cStart her, now;\\r\\ngive \\u2018em the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash,\\r\\nmy boy\\u2014start her, all; but keep cool, keep cool\\u2014cucumbers is the\\r\\nword\\u2014easy, easy\\u2014only start her like grim death and grinning\\r\\ndevils, and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves,\\r\\nboys\\u2014that\\u2019s all. Start her!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWoo-hoo! Wa-hee!\\u201d screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some\\r\\nold war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat\\r\\ninvoluntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke\\r\\nwhich the eager Indian gave.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. \\u201cKee-hee!\\r\\nKee-hee!\\u201d yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,\\r\\nlike a pacing tiger in his cage.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cKa-la! Koo-loo!\\u201d howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a\\r\\nmouthful of Grenadier\\u2019s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels\\r\\ncut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still\\r\\nencouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from\\r\\nhis mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the\\r\\nwelcome cry was heard\\u2014\\u201cStand up, Tashtego!\\u2014give it to him!\\u201d The\\r\\nharpoon was hurled. \\u201cStern all!\\u201d The oarsmen backed water; the same\\r\\nmoment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists.\\r\\nIt was the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two\\r\\nadditional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its\\r\\nincreased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled\\r\\nwith the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round and\\r\\nround the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it\\r\\nblisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb\\u2019s hands, from\\r\\nwhich the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at\\r\\nthese times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy\\u2019s\\r\\nsharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time striving\\r\\nto wrest it out of your clutch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWet the line! wet the line!\\u201d cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him\\r\\nseated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into\\r\\nit.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.\\r\\nThe boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.\\r\\nStubb and Tashtego here changed places\\u2014stem for stern\\u2014a staggering\\r\\nbusiness truly in that rocking commotion.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be\\r\\nstated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the\\r\\nrunning line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or\\r\\nbailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most\\r\\nconvenient.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of\\r\\nthe boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you would\\r\\nhave thought the craft had two keels\\u2014one cleaving the water, the other\\r\\nthe air\\u2014as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once.\\r\\nA continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy in\\r\\nher wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a little\\r\\nfinger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale\\r\\ninto the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main clinging\\r\\nto his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall form of\\r\\nTashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order to bring\\r\\ndown his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics seemed passed\\r\\nas they shot on their way, till at length the whale somewhat slackened\\r\\nhis flight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHaul in\\u2014haul in!\\u201d cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round\\r\\ntowards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while yet\\r\\nthe boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb, firmly\\r\\nplanting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart into the\\r\\nflying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately sterning out\\r\\nof the way of the whale\\u2019s horrible wallow, and then ranging up for\\r\\nanother fling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a\\r\\nhill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which bubbled\\r\\nand seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun playing\\r\\nupon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection into every\\r\\nface, so that they all glowed to each other like red men. And all\\r\\nthe while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the\\r\\nspiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of\\r\\nthe excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his crooked\\r\\nlance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again and\\r\\nagain, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and again\\r\\nsent it into the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPull up\\u2014pull up!\\u201d he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning\\r\\nwhale relaxed in his wrath. \\u201cPull up!\\u2014close to!\\u201d and the boat\\r\\nranged along the fish\\u2019s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb\\r\\nslowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there,\\r\\ncarefully churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after\\r\\nsome gold watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was\\r\\nfearful of breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he\\r\\nsought was the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck;\\r\\nfor, starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his\\r\\n\\u201cflurry,\\u201d the monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped\\r\\nhimself in impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled\\r\\ncraft, instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out\\r\\nfrom that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into view;\\r\\nsurging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting his\\r\\nspout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last, gush\\r\\nafter gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees of red\\r\\nwine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran dripping\\r\\ndown his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s dead, Mr. Stubb,\\u201d said Daggoo.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes; both pipes smoked out!\\u201d and withdrawing his own from his\\r\\nmouth, Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment,\\r\\nstood thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 62. The Dart.\\r\\n\\r\\nA word concerning an incident in the last chapter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes\\r\\noff from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary\\r\\nsteersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost\\r\\noar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong, nervous\\r\\narm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called\\r\\na long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of\\r\\ntwenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase,\\r\\nthe harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost;\\r\\nindeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the\\r\\nrest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid\\r\\nexclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the top of\\r\\none\\u2019s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half\\r\\nstarted\\u2014what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one,\\r\\nI cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same\\r\\ntime. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the fish,\\r\\nall at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting cry\\u2014\\u201cStand\\r\\nup, and give it to him!\\u201d He now has to drop and secure his oar, turn\\r\\nround on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the crotch, and\\r\\nwith what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into\\r\\nthe whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that\\r\\nout of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful; no wonder\\r\\nthat so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no\\r\\nwonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the\\r\\nboat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four\\r\\nbarrels; no wonder that to many ship owners, whaling is but a losing\\r\\nconcern; for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take\\r\\nthe breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most\\r\\nwanted!\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,\\r\\nthat is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer\\r\\nlikewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of\\r\\nthemselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and\\r\\nthe headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper\\r\\nstation in the bows of the boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both foolish\\r\\nand unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from first to\\r\\nlast; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no rowing\\r\\nwhatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances obvious\\r\\nto any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss\\r\\nof speed in the chase; but long experience in various whalemen of more\\r\\nthan one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures\\r\\nin the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the\\r\\nwhale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has\\r\\ncaused them.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this\\r\\nworld must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out of\\r\\ntoil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 63. The Crotch.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in\\r\\nproductive subjects, grow the chapters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.\\r\\nIt is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length, which\\r\\nis perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow,\\r\\nfor the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the\\r\\nharpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the prow.\\r\\nThereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it\\r\\nup as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from\\r\\nthe wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch,\\r\\nrespectively called the first and second irons.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with\\r\\nthe line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one\\r\\ninstantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the coming\\r\\ndrag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It is a\\r\\ndoubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the\\r\\ninstantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving\\r\\nthe first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however\\r\\nlightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.\\r\\nNevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line,\\r\\nand the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be\\r\\nanticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else the\\r\\nmost terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the water,\\r\\nit accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line (mentioned\\r\\nin a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances, prudently\\r\\npracticable. But this critical act is not always unattended with the\\r\\nsaddest and most fatal casualties.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown\\r\\noverboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,\\r\\nskittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,\\r\\nor cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.\\r\\nNor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is\\r\\nfairly captured and a corpse.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging\\r\\none unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these\\r\\nqualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of\\r\\nsuch an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be\\r\\nsimultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is supplied\\r\\nwith several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one\\r\\nbe ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are\\r\\nfaithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several\\r\\nmost important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be\\r\\npainted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 64. Stubb\\u2019s Supper.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb\\u2019s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was\\r\\na calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow\\r\\nbusiness of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen men\\r\\nwith our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers,\\r\\nslowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse in the\\r\\nsea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long intervals;\\r\\ngood evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we\\r\\nmoved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever they call\\r\\nit, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will draw a bulky\\r\\nfreighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this grand argosy we\\r\\ntowed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead in bulk.\\r\\n\\r\\nDarkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\nmain-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab\\r\\ndropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly eyeing\\r\\nthe heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for securing\\r\\nit for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman, went his way\\r\\ninto the cabin, and did not come forward again until morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had\\r\\nevinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the creature\\r\\nwas dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed\\r\\nworking in him; as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that\\r\\nMoby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand other whales were\\r\\nbrought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand,\\r\\nmonomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought from the sound on\\r\\nthe Pequod\\u2019s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in\\r\\nthe deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust\\r\\nrattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast\\r\\ncorpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the\\r\\nstern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black\\r\\nhull close to the vessel\\u2019s and seen through the darkness of the night,\\r\\nwhich obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two\\u2014ship and whale,\\r\\nseemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while\\r\\nthe other remains standing.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most\\r\\nreliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,\\r\\nis by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part\\r\\nis relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its\\r\\nflexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface; so\\r\\nthat with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to\\r\\nput the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a\\r\\nsmall, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end, and\\r\\na weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship. By\\r\\nadroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side\\r\\nof the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily\\r\\nmade to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last locked\\r\\nfast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with\\r\\nits broad flukes or lobes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known\\r\\non deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an\\r\\nunusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was\\r\\nhe in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned\\r\\nto him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping\\r\\ncause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely manifest.\\r\\nStubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale\\r\\nas a flavorish thing to his palate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut\\r\\nme one from his small!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general\\r\\nthing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray\\r\\nthe current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds\\r\\nof the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers\\r\\nwho have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale\\r\\ndesignated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbout midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two\\r\\nlanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper\\r\\nat the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was\\r\\nStubb the only banqueter on whale\\u2019s flesh that night. Mingling their\\r\\nmumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,\\r\\nswarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.\\r\\nThe few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp\\r\\nslapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the\\r\\nsleepers\\u2019 hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them\\r\\n(as before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and\\r\\nturning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of\\r\\nthe whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the\\r\\nshark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable\\r\\nsurface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains\\r\\na part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave\\r\\non the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in\\r\\ncountersinking for a screw.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks\\r\\nwill be seen longingly gazing up to the ship\\u2019s decks, like hungry dogs\\r\\nround a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down\\r\\nevery killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant\\r\\nbutchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other\\u2019s\\r\\nlive meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,\\r\\nalso, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away\\r\\nunder the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole\\r\\naffair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that\\r\\nis to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and\\r\\nthough sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\\r\\ncrossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in\\r\\ncase a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently\\r\\nburied; and though one or two other like instances might be set down,\\r\\ntouching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most\\r\\nsocially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no\\r\\nconceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless\\r\\nnumbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm\\r\\nwhale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never\\r\\nseen that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of\\r\\ndevil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was\\r\\ngoing on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of his\\r\\nown epicurean lips.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCook, cook!\\u2014where\\u2019s that old Fleece?\\u201d he cried at length,\\r\\nwidening his legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for\\r\\nhis supper; and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if\\r\\nstabbing with his lance; \\u201ccook, you cook!\\u2014sail this way, cook!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously\\r\\nroused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came shambling\\r\\nalong from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was something\\r\\nthe matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well scoured like\\r\\nhis other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came shuffling and\\r\\nlimping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy\\r\\nfashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered\\r\\nalong, and in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on\\r\\nthe opposite side of Stubb\\u2019s sideboard; when, with both hands folded\\r\\nbefore him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back\\r\\nstill further over, at the same time sideways inclining his head, so as\\r\\nto bring his best ear into play.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCook,\\u201d said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his\\r\\nmouth, \\u201cdon\\u2019t you think this steak is rather overdone? You\\u2019ve been\\r\\nbeating this steak too much, cook; it\\u2019s too tender. Don\\u2019t I always\\r\\nsay that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks\\r\\nnow over the side, don\\u2019t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a\\r\\nshindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to \\u2018em; tell \\u2018em they\\r\\nare welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they\\r\\nmust keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and\\r\\ndeliver my message. Here, take this lantern,\\u201d snatching one from his\\r\\nsideboard; \\u201cnow then, go and preach to \\u2018em!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck\\r\\nto the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over the\\r\\nsea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand\\r\\nhe solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a\\r\\nmumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly crawling\\r\\nbehind, overheard all that was said.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFellow-critters: I\\u2019se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam\\r\\nnoise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin\\u2019 ob de lips! Massa Stubb\\r\\nsay dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor!\\r\\nyou must stop dat dam racket!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCook,\\u201d here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden\\r\\nslap on the shoulder,\\u2014\\u201cCook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn\\u2019t\\r\\nswear that way when you\\u2019re preaching. That\\u2019s no way to convert\\r\\nsinners, cook!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho dat? Den preach to him yourself,\\u201d sullenly turning to go.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, cook; go on, go on.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, den, Belubed fellow-critters:\\u201d\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cRight!\\u201d exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, \\u201ccoax \\u2018em to it; try\\r\\nthat,\\u201d and Fleece continued.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,\\r\\nfellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness\\u2014\\u2018top dat dam slappin\\u2019 ob de\\r\\ntail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin\\u2019 and\\r\\nbitin\\u2019 dare?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCook,\\u201d cried Stubb, collaring him, \\u201cI won\\u2019t have that swearing.\\r\\nTalk to \\u2018em gentlemanly.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more the sermon proceeded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYour woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don\\u2019t blame ye so much for;\\r\\ndat is natur, and can\\u2019t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat\\r\\nis de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you,\\r\\nwhy den you be angel; for all angel is not\\u2019ing more dan de shark well\\r\\ngoberned. Now, look here, bred\\u2019ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a\\r\\nhelping yourselbs from dat whale. Don\\u2019t be tearin\\u2019 de blubber out\\r\\nyour neighbour\\u2019s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to\\r\\ndat whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat\\r\\nwhale belong to some one else. I know some o\\u2019 you has berry brig mout,\\r\\nbrigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small bellies;\\r\\nso dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to bit off de\\r\\nblubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can\\u2019t get into de scrouge to\\r\\nhelp demselves.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell done, old Fleece!\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201cthat\\u2019s Christianity; go\\r\\non.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo use goin\\u2019 on; de dam willains will keep a scougin\\u2019 and\\r\\nslappin\\u2019 each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don\\u2019t hear one word; no use\\r\\na-preaching to such dam g\\u2019uttons as you call \\u2018em, till dare bellies\\r\\nis full, and dare bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get \\u2018em full,\\r\\ndey wont hear you den; for den dey sink in the sea, go fast to sleep on\\r\\nde coral, and can\\u2019t hear noting at all, no more, for eber and eber.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cUpon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the\\r\\nbenediction, Fleece, and I\\u2019ll away to my supper.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his\\r\\nshrill voice, and cried\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill\\r\\nyour dam bellies \\u2018till dey bust\\u2014and den die.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow, cook,\\u201d said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan;\\r\\n\\u201cstand just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay\\r\\nparticular attention.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll \\u2018dention,\\u201d said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in\\r\\nthe desired position.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell,\\u201d said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; \\u201cI shall now\\r\\ngo back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are\\r\\nyou, cook?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat dat do wid de \\u2018teak,\\u201d said the old black, testily.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSilence! How old are you, cook?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Bout ninety, dey say,\\u201d he gloomily muttered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,\\r\\nand don\\u2019t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?\\u201d rapidly bolting\\r\\nanother mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation\\r\\nof the question. \\u201cWhere were you born, cook?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin\\u2019 ober de Roanoke.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBorn in a ferry-boat! That\\u2019s queer, too. But I want to know what\\r\\ncountry you were born in, cook!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDidn\\u2019t I say de Roanoke country?\\u201d he cried sharply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, you didn\\u2019t, cook; but I\\u2019ll tell you what I\\u2019m coming to,\\r\\ncook. You must go home and be born over again; you don\\u2019t know how to\\r\\ncook a whale-steak yet.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBress my soul, if I cook noder one,\\u201d he growled, angrily, turning\\r\\nround to depart.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome back here, cook;\\u2014here, hand me those tongs;\\u2014now take that\\r\\nbit of steak there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it\\r\\nshould be? Take it, I say\\u201d\\u2014holding the tongs towards him\\u2014\\u201ctake\\r\\nit, and taste it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFaintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro\\r\\nmuttered, \\u201cBest cooked \\u2018teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCook,\\u201d said Stubb, squaring himself once more; \\u201cdo you belong to\\r\\nthe church?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPassed one once in Cape-Down,\\u201d said the old man sullenly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,\\r\\nwhere you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as\\r\\nhis beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here,\\r\\nand tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?\\u201d said Stubb.\\r\\n\\u201cWhere do you expect to go to, cook?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGo to bed berry soon,\\u201d he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It\\u2019s an awful question.\\r\\nNow what\\u2019s your answer?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhen dis old brack man dies,\\u201d said the negro slowly, changing\\r\\nhis whole air and demeanor, \\u201che hisself won\\u2019t go nowhere; but some\\r\\nbressed angel will come and fetch him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And\\r\\nfetch him where?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cUp dere,\\u201d said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head,\\r\\nand keeping it there very solemnly.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSo, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when\\r\\nyou are dead? But don\\u2019t you know the higher you climb, the colder it\\r\\ngets? Main-top, eh?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDidn\\u2019t say dat t\\u2019all,\\u201d said Fleece, again in the sulks.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYou said up there, didn\\u2019t you? and now look yourself, and see where\\r\\nyour tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven\\r\\nby crawling through the lubber\\u2019s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you\\r\\ndon\\u2019t get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging.\\r\\nIt\\u2019s a ticklish business, but must be done, or else it\\u2019s no go. But\\r\\nnone of us are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders.\\r\\nDo ye hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t\\u2019other a\\u2019top of\\r\\nyour heart, when I\\u2019m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart,\\r\\nthere?\\u2014that\\u2019s your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!\\u2014that\\u2019s it\\u2014now you\\r\\nhave it. Hold it there now, and pay attention.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll \\u2018dention,\\u201d said the old black, with both hands placed as\\r\\ndesired, vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in\\r\\nfront at one and the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,\\r\\nthat I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,\\r\\ndon\\u2019t you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for\\r\\nmy private table here, the capstan, I\\u2019ll tell you what to do so as not\\r\\nto spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live\\r\\ncoal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d\\u2019ye hear? And now\\r\\nto-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by\\r\\nto get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends of\\r\\nthe flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.\\r\\nD\\u2019ye hear? away you sail, then.\\u2014Halloa! stop! make a bow before\\r\\nyou go.\\u2014Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast\\u2014don\\u2019t\\r\\nforget.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWish, by gor! whale eat him, \\u2018stead of him eat whale. I\\u2019m bressed\\r\\nif he ain\\u2019t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,\\u201d muttered the old\\r\\nman, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,\\r\\nlike Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so\\r\\noutlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\\r\\nphilosophy of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\\r\\nWhale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\\r\\nprices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth\\u2019s time, a certain cook of the\\r\\ncourt obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\\r\\neaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\\r\\nwhale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\\r\\nmeat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well\\r\\nseasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\\r\\nThe old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\\r\\nporpoise grant from the crown.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\\r\\nhands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\\r\\nwhen you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\\r\\nlong, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\\r\\nlike Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not\\r\\nso fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\\r\\nold vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\\r\\ndoctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\\r\\njuicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\\r\\nlong ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel\\u2014that\\r\\nthese men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\\r\\nwhales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\\r\\nthe Dutch whalemen these scraps are called \\u201cfritters\\u201d; which,\\r\\nindeed, they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling\\r\\nsomething like old Amsterdam housewives\\u2019 dough-nuts or oly-cooks,\\r\\nwhen fresh. They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying\\r\\nstranger can hardly keep his hands off.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\\r\\nexceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\\r\\ndelicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the\\r\\nbuffalo\\u2019s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\\r\\npyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\\r\\nis; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\\r\\nthird month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\\r\\nbutter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\\r\\nsome other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try\\r\\nwatches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\\r\\nship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many\\r\\na good supper have I thus made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.\\r\\nThe casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,\\r\\nwhitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings),\\r\\nthey are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess,\\r\\nin flavor somewhat resembling calves\\u2019 head, which is quite a dish\\r\\namong some epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the\\r\\nepicures, by continually dining upon calves\\u2019 brains, by and by get to\\r\\nhave a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a\\r\\ncalf\\u2019s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon\\r\\ndiscrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with an\\r\\nintelligent looking calf\\u2019s head before him, is somehow one of the\\r\\nsaddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at\\r\\nhim, with an \\u201cEt tu Brute!\\u201d expression.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\\r\\nunctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence;\\r\\nthat appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before\\r\\nmentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea,\\r\\nand eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever\\r\\nmurdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if\\r\\nhe had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and\\r\\nhe certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market\\r\\nof a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the\\r\\nlong rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of\\r\\nthe cannibal\\u2019s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a cannibal? I tell you it\\r\\nwill be more tolerable for the Fejee that salted down a lean missionary\\r\\nin his cellar against a coming famine; it will be more tolerable for\\r\\nthat provident Fejee, I say, in the day of judgment, than for thee,\\r\\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand, who nailest geese to the ground and\\r\\nfeastest on their bloated livers in thy pate-de-foie-gras.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is\\r\\nadding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my\\r\\ncivilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is\\r\\nthat handle made of?\\u2014what but the bones of the brother of the very ox\\r\\nyou are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring\\r\\nthat fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill did\\r\\nthe Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to Ganders\\r\\nformally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month or two\\r\\nthat that society passed a resolution to patronise nothing but steel\\r\\npens.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and\\r\\nweary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general\\r\\nthing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting\\r\\nhim in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very\\r\\nsoon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the\\r\\ncommon usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a\\u2019lee; and then\\r\\nsend every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation\\r\\nthat, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and\\r\\ntwo for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck\\r\\nto see that all goes well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will\\r\\nnot answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather\\r\\nround the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a\\r\\nstretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning.\\r\\nIn most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so\\r\\nlargely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably\\r\\ndiminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades,\\r\\na procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to\\r\\ntickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the\\r\\npresent case with the Pequod\\u2019s sharks; though, to be sure, any man\\r\\nunaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,\\r\\nwould have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and\\r\\nthose sharks the maggots in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was\\r\\nconcluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman\\r\\ncame on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for\\r\\nimmediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering\\r\\nthree lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid\\r\\nsea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an\\r\\nincessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep\\r\\ninto their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy\\r\\nconfusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not\\r\\nalways hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the\\r\\nincredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at each\\r\\nother\\u2019s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and bit\\r\\ntheir own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by\\r\\nthe same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was\\r\\nthis all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these\\r\\ncreatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in\\r\\ntheir very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual\\r\\nlife had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,\\r\\none of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg\\u2019s hand off, when he\\r\\ntried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.\\r\\n\\r\\n*The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;\\r\\nis about the bigness of a man\\u2019s spread hand; and in general shape,\\r\\ncorresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its\\r\\nsides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than\\r\\nthe lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when\\r\\nbeing used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a\\r\\nstiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cQueequeg no care what god made him shark,\\u201d said the savage,\\r\\nagonizingly lifting his hand up and down; \\u201cwedder Fejee god or\\r\\nNantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 67. Cutting In.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio\\r\\nprofessors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was\\r\\nturned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would\\r\\nhave thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous\\r\\nthings comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and which\\r\\nno single man can possibly lift\\u2014this vast bunch of grapes was swayed\\r\\nup to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the\\r\\nstrongest point anywhere above a ship\\u2019s deck. The end of the\\r\\nhawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted\\r\\nto the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung\\r\\nover the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one\\r\\nhundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the\\r\\nside, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades, began\\r\\ncutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the\\r\\nnearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is\\r\\ncut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew\\r\\nstriking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at\\r\\nthe windlass. When instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side;\\r\\nevery bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty\\r\\nweather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to\\r\\nthe sky. More and more she leans over to the whale, while every gasping\\r\\nheave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows;\\r\\ntill at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the\\r\\nship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant\\r\\ntackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular\\r\\nend of the first strip of blubber. Now as the blubber envelopes the\\r\\nwhale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from\\r\\nthe body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it.\\r\\nFor the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps\\r\\nthe whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in\\r\\none strip uniformly peels off along the line called the \\u201cscarf,\\u201d\\r\\nsimultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates;\\r\\nand just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act\\r\\nitself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till\\r\\nits upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease\\r\\nheaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass\\r\\nsways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must\\r\\ntake good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and\\r\\npitch him headlong overboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon\\r\\ncalled a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices\\r\\nout a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into this\\r\\nhole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked\\r\\nso as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for what\\r\\nfollows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands to\\r\\nstand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a few\\r\\nsidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in twain;\\r\\nso that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper strip,\\r\\ncalled a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for lowering.\\r\\nThe heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one tackle is\\r\\npeeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other is slowly\\r\\nslackened away, and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway\\r\\nright beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the blubber-room. Into\\r\\nthis twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long\\r\\nblanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents.\\r\\nAnd thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering\\r\\nsimultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing,\\r\\nthe blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship\\r\\nstraining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the\\r\\ngeneral friction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 68. The Blanket.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of\\r\\nthe whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen\\r\\nafloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains\\r\\nunchanged; but it is only an opinion.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you\\r\\nknow what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence\\r\\nof firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and\\r\\nranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any\\r\\ncreature\\u2019s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness,\\r\\nyet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;\\r\\nbecause you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer\\r\\nof any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin? True,\\r\\nfrom the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with your\\r\\nhand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat resembling the\\r\\nthinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as flexible and soft as\\r\\nsatin; that is, previous to being dried, when it not only contracts and\\r\\nthickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I have several such dried\\r\\nbits, which I use for marks in my whale-books. It is transparent, as\\r\\nI said before; and being laid upon the printed page, I have sometimes\\r\\npleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence. At any\\r\\nrate, it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles,\\r\\nas you may say. But what I am driving at here is this. That same\\r\\ninfinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I admit, invests the entire\\r\\nbody of the whale, is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the\\r\\ncreature, as the skin of the skin, so to speak; for it were simply\\r\\nridiculous to say, that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is\\r\\nthinner and more tender than the skin of a new-born child. But no more\\r\\nof this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,\\r\\nas in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one\\r\\nhundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or\\r\\nrather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths,\\r\\nand not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had\\r\\nof the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere\\r\\nintegument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels\\r\\nto the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters\\r\\nof the stuff of the whale\\u2019s skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among\\r\\nthe many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely\\r\\ncrossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array,\\r\\nsomething like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these\\r\\nmarks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above\\r\\nmentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved\\r\\nupon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,\\r\\nobservant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but\\r\\nafford the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical;\\r\\nthat is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids\\r\\nhieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present\\r\\nconnexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm\\r\\nWhale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old\\r\\nIndian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on\\r\\nthe banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the\\r\\nmystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian\\r\\nrocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which\\r\\nthe exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the\\r\\nback, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the\\r\\nregular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches,\\r\\naltogether of an irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New\\r\\nEngland rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks\\r\\nof violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs\\u2014I should say,\\r\\nthat those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this\\r\\nparticular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are\\r\\nprobably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most\\r\\nremarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species.\\r\\n\\r\\nA word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of\\r\\nthe whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\\r\\npieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very\\r\\nhappy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber\\r\\nas in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho\\r\\nslipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this\\r\\ncosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself\\r\\ncomfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would\\r\\nbecome of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the\\r\\nNorth, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are\\r\\nfound exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it\\r\\nobserved, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies\\r\\nare refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of\\r\\nan iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire;\\r\\nwhereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood,\\r\\nand he dies. How wonderful is it then\\u2014except after explanation\\u2014that\\r\\nthis great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it\\r\\nis to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed\\r\\nto his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall\\r\\noverboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly\\r\\nfrozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued\\r\\nin amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been proved by\\r\\nexperiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a\\r\\nBorneo negro in summer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong\\r\\nindividual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare\\r\\nvirtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself after\\r\\nthe whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too, live in\\r\\nthis world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep thy blood\\r\\nfluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter\\u2019s, and like the\\r\\ngreat whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of thine own.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,\\r\\nhow few are domed like St. Peter\\u2019s! of creatures, how few vast as the\\r\\nwhale!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 69. The Funeral.\\r\\n\\r\\nHaul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!\\r\\n\\r\\nThe vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the\\r\\nbeheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,\\r\\nit has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.\\r\\nSlowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and\\r\\nsplashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with rapacious\\r\\nflights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many insulting\\r\\nponiards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats further\\r\\nand further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats, what seem\\r\\nsquare roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the murderous\\r\\ndin. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous\\r\\nsight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon the fair\\r\\nface of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that great mass\\r\\nof death floats on and on, till lost in infinite perspectives.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\\u2019s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures\\r\\nall in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or\\r\\nspeckled. In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween,\\r\\nif peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral\\r\\nthey most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from\\r\\nwhich not the mightiest whale is free.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost\\r\\nsurvives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or\\r\\nblundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the\\r\\nswarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in\\r\\nthe sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the\\r\\nlog\\u2014shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware! And for years\\r\\nafterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly\\r\\nsheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there\\r\\nwhen a stick was held. There\\u2019s your law of precedents; there\\u2019s your\\r\\nutility of traditions; there\\u2019s the story of your obstinate survival\\r\\nof old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in\\r\\nthe air! There\\u2019s orthodoxy!\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, while in life the great whale\\u2019s body may have been a real terror\\r\\nto his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than\\r\\nthe Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe in\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping\\r\\nthe body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the\\r\\nSperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced\\r\\nwhale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;\\r\\non the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that\\r\\nvery place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the\\r\\nsurgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening\\r\\nbetween him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a\\r\\ndiscoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear\\r\\nin mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many\\r\\nfeet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without so\\r\\nmuch as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus\\r\\nmade, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,\\r\\nand exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion\\r\\ninto the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb\\u2019s boast, that he\\r\\ndemanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable\\r\\ntill the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small whale\\r\\nit is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a\\r\\nfull grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale\\u2019s head\\r\\nembraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend\\r\\nsuch a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this\\r\\nwere as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers\\u2019\\r\\nscales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod\\u2019s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head\\r\\nwas hoisted against the ship\\u2019s side\\u2014about half way out of the sea,\\r\\nso that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element.\\r\\nAnd there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason\\r\\nof the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every\\r\\nyard-arm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there,\\r\\nthat blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod\\u2019s waist like the giant\\r\\nHolofernes\\u2019s from the girdle of Judith.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went\\r\\nbelow to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but\\r\\nnow deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow\\r\\nlotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon\\r\\nthe sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nA short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone\\r\\nfrom his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to\\r\\ngaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took\\r\\nStubb\\u2019s long spade\\u2014still remaining there after the whale\\u2019s\\r\\nDecapitation\\u2014and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended\\r\\nmass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood\\r\\nleaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so\\r\\nintense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx\\u2019s in the desert. \\u201cSpeak, thou\\r\\nvast and venerable head,\\u201d muttered Ahab, \\u201cwhich, though ungarnished\\r\\nwith a beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak,\\r\\nmighty head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all\\r\\ndivers, thou hast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun\\r\\nnow gleams, has moved amid this world\\u2019s foundations. Where unrecorded\\r\\nnames and navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her\\r\\nmurderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions\\r\\nof the drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most\\r\\nfamiliar home. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept\\r\\nby many a sailor\\u2019s side, where sleepless mothers would give their\\r\\nlives to lay them down. Thou saw\\u2019st the locked lovers when leaping\\r\\nfrom their flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting\\r\\nwave; true to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou\\r\\nsaw\\u2019st the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight\\r\\ndeck; for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw;\\r\\nand his murderers still sailed on unharmed\\u2014while swift lightnings\\r\\nshivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband\\r\\nto outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split\\r\\nthe planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is\\r\\nthine!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSail ho!\\u201d cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye? Well, now, that\\u2019s cheering,\\u201d cried Ahab, suddenly erecting\\r\\nhimself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow.\\r\\n\\u201cThat lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better\\r\\nman.\\u2014Where away?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThree points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze\\r\\nto us!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBetter and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way,\\r\\nand to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man!\\r\\nhow far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the smallest\\r\\natom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate in mind.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam\\u2019s Story.\\r\\n\\r\\nHand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than\\r\\nthe ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy and by, through the glass the stranger\\u2019s boats and manned\\r\\nmast-heads proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward,\\r\\nand shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the\\r\\nPequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what\\r\\nresponse would be made.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships of\\r\\nthe American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which signals\\r\\nbeing collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels\\r\\nattached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale\\r\\ncommanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at\\r\\nconsiderable distances and with no small facility.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod\\u2019s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\\u2019s\\r\\nsetting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.\\r\\nSquaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\nlee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was\\r\\nbeing rigged by Starbuck\\u2019s order to accommodate the visiting captain,\\r\\nthe stranger in question waved his hand from his boat\\u2019s stern in token\\r\\nof that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that\\r\\nthe Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her\\r\\ncaptain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod\\u2019s company. For, though\\r\\nhimself and boat\\u2019s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was\\r\\nhalf a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and\\r\\nflowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of\\r\\nthe land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the\\r\\nPequod.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an\\r\\ninterval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam\\u2019s\\r\\nboat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the\\r\\nPequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it blew\\r\\nvery fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times by\\r\\nthe sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed some\\r\\nway ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings\\r\\nagain. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now and then, a\\r\\nconversation was sustained between the two parties; but at intervals not\\r\\nwithout still another interruption of a very different sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nPulling an oar in the Jeroboam\\u2019s boat, was a man of a singular\\r\\nappearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities\\r\\nmake up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish man, sprinkled\\r\\nall over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant yellow hair. A\\r\\nlong-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped\\r\\nhim; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists. A\\r\\ndeep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had\\r\\nexclaimed\\u2014\\u201cThat\\u2019s he! that\\u2019s he!\\u2014the long-togged scaramouch\\r\\nthe Town-Ho\\u2019s company told us of!\\u201d Stubb here alluded to a strange\\r\\nstory told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time\\r\\nprevious when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account\\r\\nand what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in\\r\\nquestion had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the\\r\\nJeroboam. His story was this:\\r\\n\\r\\nHe had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna\\r\\nShakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret\\r\\nmeetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a\\r\\ntrap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he\\r\\ncarried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing gunpowder,\\r\\nwas supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange, apostolic whim\\r\\nhaving seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with\\r\\nthat cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense\\r\\nexterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the\\r\\nJeroboam\\u2019s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon\\r\\nthe ship\\u2019s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in a\\r\\nfreshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded\\r\\nthe captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby\\r\\nhe set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\\r\\nvicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which he\\r\\ndeclared these things;\\u2014the dark, daring play of his sleepless, excited\\r\\nimagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium, united\\r\\nto invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant\\r\\ncrew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they were afraid of\\r\\nhim. As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship,\\r\\nespecially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous\\r\\ncaptain would fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that\\r\\nindividual\\u2019s intention was to land him in the first convenient port,\\r\\nthe archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials\\u2014devoting the\\r\\nship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention\\r\\nwas carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the\\r\\ncrew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if\\r\\nGabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was\\r\\ntherefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel\\r\\nto be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to\\r\\npass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence\\r\\nof all this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the\\r\\ncaptain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a\\r\\nhigher hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was\\r\\nat his sole command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good\\r\\npleasure. The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them\\r\\nfawned before him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering\\r\\nhim personal homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but,\\r\\nhowever wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half\\r\\nso striking in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic\\r\\nhimself, as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many\\r\\nothers. But it is time to return to the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI fear not thy epidemic, man,\\u201d said Ahab from the bulwarks, to\\r\\nCaptain Mayhew, who stood in the boat\\u2019s stern; \\u201ccome on board.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now Gabriel started to his feet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThink, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the\\r\\nhorrible plague!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGabriel! Gabriel!\\u201d cried Captain Mayhew; \\u201cthou must either\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\nBut that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its\\r\\nseethings drowned all speech.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHast thou seen the White Whale?\\u201d demanded Ahab, when the boat\\r\\ndrifted back.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThink, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the\\r\\nhorrible tail!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI tell thee again, Gabriel, that\\u2014\\u201d But again the boat tore ahead\\r\\nas if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a\\r\\nsuccession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional\\r\\ncaprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the\\r\\nhoisted sperm whale\\u2019s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel\\r\\nwas seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel\\r\\nnature seemed to warrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\\r\\nconcerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from\\r\\nGabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed\\r\\nleagued with him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking\\r\\na whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby\\r\\nDick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,\\r\\nGabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White\\r\\nWhale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity,\\r\\npronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God\\r\\nincarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two\\r\\nafterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the\\r\\nchief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself\\r\\nbeing not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all\\r\\nthe archangel\\u2019s denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in\\r\\npersuading five men to man his boat. With them he pushed off; and, after\\r\\nmuch weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last\\r\\nsucceeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to\\r\\nthe main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and\\r\\nhurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants\\r\\nof his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his\\r\\nboat\\u2019s bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting\\r\\nhis wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance\\r\\nfor his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its\\r\\nquick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies\\r\\nof the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious\\r\\nlife, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his\\r\\ndescent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a\\r\\nchip of the boat was harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman\\u2019s head; but the\\r\\nmate for ever sank.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the\\r\\nSperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.\\r\\nSometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;\\r\\noftener the boat\\u2019s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which\\r\\nthe headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body.\\r\\nBut strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than\\r\\none, when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is\\r\\ndiscernible; the man being stark dead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly descried\\r\\nfrom the ship. Raising a piercing shriek\\u2014\\u201cThe vial! the vial!\\u201d\\r\\nGabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting\\r\\nof the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added\\r\\ninfluence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had\\r\\nspecifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general\\r\\nprophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one\\r\\nof many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to\\r\\nthe ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to\\r\\nhim, that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he\\r\\nintended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which\\r\\nAhab answered\\u2014\\u201cAye.\\u201d Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started\\r\\nto his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\\r\\ndownward pointed finger\\u2014\\u201cThink, think of the blasphemer\\u2014dead, and\\r\\ndown there!\\u2014beware of the blasphemer\\u2019s end!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, \\u201cCaptain, I have\\r\\njust bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy\\r\\nofficers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships,\\r\\nwhose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed, depends\\r\\nupon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans. Thus,\\r\\nmost letters never reach their mark; and many are only received after\\r\\nattaining an age of two or three years or more.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,\\r\\ndamp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence\\r\\nof being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death\\r\\nhimself might well have been the post-boy.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCan\\u2019st not read it?\\u201d cried Ahab. \\u201cGive it me, man. Aye, aye,\\r\\nit\\u2019s but a dim scrawl;\\u2014what\\u2019s this?\\u201d As he was studying it out,\\r\\nStarbuck took a long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly\\r\\nsplit the end, to insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to\\r\\nthe boat, without its coming any closer to the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, \\u201cMr. Har\\u2014yes,\\r\\nMr. Harry\\u2014(a woman\\u2019s pinny hand,\\u2014the man\\u2019s wife, I\\u2019ll\\r\\nwager)\\u2014Aye\\u2014Mr. Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;\\u2014why it\\u2019s Macey, and\\r\\nhe\\u2019s dead!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPoor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,\\u201d sighed Mayhew; \\u201cbut\\r\\nlet me have it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNay, keep it thyself,\\u201d cried Gabriel to Ahab; \\u201cthou art soon\\r\\ngoing that way.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCurses throttle thee!\\u201d yelled Ahab. \\u201cCaptain Mayhew, stand by now\\r\\nto receive it\\u201d; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck\\u2019s hands,\\r\\nhe caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the\\r\\nboat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;\\r\\nthe boat drifted a little towards the ship\\u2019s stern; so that, as if by\\r\\nmagic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel\\u2019s eager hand.\\r\\nHe clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling\\r\\nthe letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way\\r\\nwith their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away\\r\\nfrom the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket\\r\\nof the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild\\r\\naffair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there\\r\\nis much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are\\r\\nwanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying\\r\\nin any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done\\r\\neverywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description\\r\\nof the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned\\r\\nthat upon first breaking ground in the whale\\u2019s back, the blubber-hook\\r\\nwas inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the\\r\\nmates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook\\r\\nget fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend\\r\\nQueequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the\\r\\nmonster\\u2019s back for the special purpose referred to. But in very many\\r\\ncases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the\\r\\nwhale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded. The\\r\\nwhale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the\\r\\nimmediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the\\r\\nlevel of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the\\r\\nwhale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill\\r\\nbeneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the\\r\\nHighland costume\\u2014a shirt and socks\\u2014in which to my eyes, at least,\\r\\nhe appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better chance to\\r\\nobserve him, as will presently be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing the savage\\u2019s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar\\r\\nin his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to\\r\\nattend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape\\r\\nby a long cord. Just so, from the ship\\u2019s steep side, did I hold\\r\\nQueequeg down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the\\r\\nfishery a monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round\\r\\nhis waist.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we\\r\\nproceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both\\r\\nends; fast to Queequeg\\u2019s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow\\r\\nleather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were\\r\\nwedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage\\r\\nand honour demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag\\r\\nme down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature united us.\\r\\nQueequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I any way get\\r\\nrid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then, that\\r\\nwhile earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to perceive\\r\\nthat my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of\\r\\ntwo; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that another\\u2019s\\r\\nmistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster\\r\\nand death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of interregnum in\\r\\nProvidence; for its even-handed equity never could have so gross an\\r\\ninjustice. And yet still further pondering\\u2014while I jerked him now\\r\\nand then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten to jam\\r\\nhim\\u2014still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of mine\\r\\nwas the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in most\\r\\ncases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a plurality\\r\\nof other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your apothecary by\\r\\nmistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True, you may say\\r\\nthat, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these and the\\r\\nmultitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg\\u2019s\\r\\nmonkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I came\\r\\nvery near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do what I\\r\\nwould, I only had the management of one end of it.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod\\r\\nthat the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This improvement\\r\\nupon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb,\\r\\nin order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible\\r\\nguarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between\\r\\nthe whale and the ship\\u2014where he would occasionally fall, from the\\r\\nincessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming\\r\\njeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them\\r\\nduring the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by\\r\\nthe before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass\\u2014the rabid\\r\\ncreatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them\\r\\naside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were\\r\\nit not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise\\r\\nmiscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a\\r\\nravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them.\\r\\nAccordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then jerked\\r\\nthe poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed\\r\\na peculiarly ferocious shark\\u2014he was provided with still another\\r\\nprotection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego\\r\\nand Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen\\r\\nwhale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could\\r\\nreach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and\\r\\nbenevolent of them. They meant Queequeg\\u2019s best happiness, I admit; but\\r\\nin their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that both\\r\\nhe and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled water,\\r\\nthose indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg\\r\\nthan a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping there\\r\\nwith that great iron hook\\u2014poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed to his\\r\\nYojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in\\r\\nand then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea\\u2014what matters\\r\\nit, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men\\r\\nin this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those\\r\\nsharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks\\r\\nand spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now, as\\r\\nwith blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs\\r\\nup the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over\\r\\nthe side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent, consolatory\\r\\nglance hands him\\u2014what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye gods! hands\\r\\nhim a cup of tepid ginger and water!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGinger? Do I smell ginger?\\u201d suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.\\r\\n\\u201cYes, this must be ginger,\\u201d peering into the as yet untasted cup.\\r\\nThen standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards\\r\\nthe astonished steward slowly saying, \\u201cGinger? ginger? and will you\\r\\nhave the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of\\r\\nginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to kindle\\r\\na fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!\\u2014what the devil is ginger?\\r\\nSea-coal? firewood?\\u2014lucifer matches?\\u2014tinder?\\u2014gunpowder?\\u2014what\\r\\nthe devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor Queequeg\\r\\nhere.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this\\r\\nbusiness,\\u201d he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just\\r\\ncome from forward. \\u201cWill you look at that kannakin, sir; smell of\\r\\nit, if you please.\\u201d Then watching the mate\\u2019s countenance, he added,\\r\\n\\u201cThe steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and\\r\\njalap to Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an\\r\\napothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by\\r\\nwhich he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI trust not,\\u201d said Starbuck, \\u201cit is poor stuff enough.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye, steward,\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll teach you to drug\\r\\na harpooneer; none of your apothecary\\u2019s medicine here; you want to\\r\\npoison us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to\\r\\nmurder us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt was not me,\\u201d cried Dough-Boy, \\u201cit was Aunt Charity that\\r\\nbrought the ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any\\r\\nspirits, but only this ginger-jub\\u2014so she called it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGinger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye\\r\\nto the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck. It is the captain\\u2019s orders\\u2014grog for the harpooneer on a\\r\\nwhale.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEnough,\\u201d replied Starbuck, \\u201conly don\\u2019t hit him again, but\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something\\r\\nof that sort; and this fellow\\u2019s a weazel. What were you about saying,\\r\\nsir?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOnly this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a sort\\r\\nof tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and was\\r\\nhanded to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity\\u2019s gift, and that was\\r\\nfreely given to the waves.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask Kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk\\r\\n\\r\\nOver Him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale\\u2019s\\r\\nprodigious head hanging to the Pequod\\u2019s side. But we must let it\\r\\ncontinue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it.\\r\\nFor the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for the\\r\\nhead, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually\\r\\ndrifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,\\r\\ngave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the\\r\\nLeviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking\\r\\nanywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of\\r\\nthose inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to\\r\\ncruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near\\r\\nthe Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale\\r\\nhad been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the\\r\\nannouncement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day, if\\r\\nopportunity offered.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two\\r\\nboats, Stubb\\u2019s and Flask\\u2019s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling\\r\\nfurther and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the\\r\\nmen at the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great\\r\\nheap of tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that\\r\\none or both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats\\r\\nwere in plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship\\r\\nby the towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at\\r\\nfirst it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a\\r\\nmaelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from\\r\\nview, as if diving under the keel. \\u201cCut, cut!\\u201d was the cry from the\\r\\nship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being\\r\\nbrought with a deadly dash against the vessel\\u2019s side. But having\\r\\nplenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly,\\r\\nthey paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with\\r\\nall their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the\\r\\nstruggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the\\r\\ntightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another,\\r\\nthe contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a\\r\\nfew feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did\\r\\ngain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning\\r\\nalong the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,\\r\\nsuddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so\\r\\nflinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken\\r\\nglass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once\\r\\nmore the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,\\r\\nand blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship towing\\r\\nthe two boats after him, so that they performed a complete circuit.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close\\r\\nflanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for\\r\\nlance; and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the\\r\\nmultitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale\\u2019s\\r\\nbody, rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking\\r\\nat every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting\\r\\nfountains that poured from the smitten rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he\\r\\nturned upon his back a corpse.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,\\r\\nand in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some\\r\\nconversation ensued between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,\\u201d said\\r\\nStubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so\\r\\nignoble a leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWants with it?\\u201d said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat\\u2019s\\r\\nbow, \\u201cdid you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\u2019s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a\\r\\nRight Whale\\u2019s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that\\r\\nship can never afterwards capsize?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy not?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying\\r\\nso, and he seems to know all about ships\\u2019 charms. But I sometimes\\r\\nthink he\\u2019ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don\\u2019t half like\\r\\nthat chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of\\r\\ncarved into a snake\\u2019s head, Stubb?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of\\r\\na dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look\\r\\ndown there, Flask\\u201d\\u2014pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of\\r\\nboth hands\\u2014\\u201cAye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil\\r\\nin disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having\\r\\nbeen stowed away on board ship? He\\u2019s the devil, I say. The reason why\\r\\nyou don\\u2019t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he\\r\\ncarries it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I\\r\\nthink of it, he\\u2019s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his\\r\\nboots.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe sleeps in his boots, don\\u2019t he? He hasn\\u2019t got any hammock; but\\r\\nI\\u2019ve seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo doubt, and it\\u2019s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do\\r\\nye see, in the eye of the rigging.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the old man have so much to do with him for?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStriking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBargain?\\u2014about what?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and\\r\\nthe devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away\\r\\nhis silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then\\r\\nhe\\u2019ll surrender Moby Dick.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked\\r\\none, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the\\r\\nold flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and\\r\\ngentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he\\r\\nwas at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching\\r\\nhis hoofs, up and says, \\u2018I want John.\\u2019 \\u2018What for?\\u2019 says the old\\r\\ngovernor. \\u2018What business is that of yours,\\u2019 says the devil, getting\\r\\nmad,\\u2014\\u2018I want to use him.\\u2019 \\u2018Take him,\\u2019 says the governor\\u2014and\\r\\nby the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn\\u2019t give John the Asiatic cholera\\r\\nbefore he got through with him, I\\u2019ll eat this whale in one mouthful.\\r\\nBut look sharp\\u2014ain\\u2019t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead,\\r\\nand let\\u2019s get the whale alongside.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI think I remember some such story as you were telling,\\u201d said\\r\\nFlask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their\\r\\nburden towards the ship, \\u201cbut I can\\u2019t remember where.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThree Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soladoes?\\r\\nDid ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,\\r\\nStubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was\\r\\nthe same you say is now on board the Pequod?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAm I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn\\u2019t the devil\\r\\nlive for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever\\r\\nsee any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a\\r\\nlatch-key to get into the admiral\\u2019s cabin, don\\u2019t you suppose he can\\r\\ncrawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo you see that mainmast there?\\u201d pointing to the ship; \\u201cwell,\\r\\nthat\\u2019s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod\\u2019s hold,\\r\\nand string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well,\\r\\nthat wouldn\\u2019t begin to be Fedallah\\u2019s age. Nor all the coopers in\\r\\ncreation couldn\\u2019t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that\\r\\nyou meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if\\r\\nhe\\u2019s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going\\r\\nto live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard\\u2014tell me\\r\\nthat?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGive him a good ducking, anyhow.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut he\\u2019d crawl back.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDuck him again; and keep ducking him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSuppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though\\u2014yes,\\r\\nand drown you\\u2014what then?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI should like to see him try it; I\\u2019d give him such a pair of black\\r\\neyes that he wouldn\\u2019t dare to show his face in the admiral\\u2019s cabin\\r\\nagain for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he\\r\\nlives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn\\r\\nthe devil, Flask; so you suppose I\\u2019m afraid of the devil? Who\\u2019s\\r\\nafraid of him, except the old governor who daresn\\u2019t catch him and put\\r\\nhim in double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping\\r\\npeople; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil\\r\\nkidnapped, he\\u2019d roast for him? There\\u2019s a governor!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo I suppose it? You\\u2019ll know it before long, Flask. But I am\\r\\ngoing now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very\\r\\nsuspicious going on, I\\u2019ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and\\r\\nsay\\u2014Look here, Beelzebub, you don\\u2019t do it; and if he makes any fuss,\\r\\nby the Lord I\\u2019ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to\\r\\nthe capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail\\r\\nwill come short off at the stump\\u2014do you see; and then, I rather guess\\r\\nwhen he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he\\u2019ll sneak off\\r\\nwithout the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd what will you do with the tail, Stubb?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDo with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;\\u2014what else?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNow, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along,\\r\\nStubb?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMean or not mean, here we are at the ship.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where\\r\\nfluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDidn\\u2019t I tell you so?\\u201d said Flask; \\u201cyes, you\\u2019ll soon see this\\r\\nright whale\\u2019s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti\\u2019s.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn good time, Flask\\u2019s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod\\r\\nsteeply leaned over towards the sperm whale\\u2019s head, now, by the\\r\\ncounterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely\\r\\nstrained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in\\r\\nLocke\\u2019s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist\\r\\nin Kant\\u2019s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus,\\r\\nsome minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these\\r\\nthunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the\\r\\nship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the\\r\\ncase of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off\\r\\nwhole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and\\r\\nhoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is\\r\\ncalled the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present case,\\r\\nhad been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and\\r\\nthe head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of\\r\\noverburdening panniers.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale\\u2019s head, and ever\\r\\nand anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own\\r\\nhand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow;\\r\\nwhile, if the Parsee\\u2019s shadow was there at all it seemed only to\\r\\nblend with, and lengthen Ahab\\u2019s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish\\r\\nspeculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing\\r\\nthings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale\\u2019s Head\\u2014Contrasted View.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\\r\\njoin them, and lay together our own.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\\r\\nWhale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly\\r\\nhunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all\\r\\nthe known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between\\r\\nthem is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this\\r\\nmoment hanging from the Pequod\\u2019s side; and as we may freely go from\\r\\none to the other, by merely stepping across the deck:\\u2014where, I\\r\\nshould like to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical\\r\\ncetology than here?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these\\r\\nheads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain\\r\\nmathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale\\u2019s which the Right Whale\\u2019s\\r\\nsadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale\\u2019s head. As you\\r\\nbehold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in\\r\\npoint of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity\\r\\nis heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit,\\r\\ngiving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what\\r\\nthe fishermen technically call a \\u201cgrey-headed whale.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads\\u2014namely, the\\r\\ntwo most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of\\r\\nthe head, and low down, near the angle of either whale\\u2019s jaw, if you\\r\\nnarrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\\r\\nfancy to be a young colt\\u2019s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\\r\\nmagnitude of the head.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale\\u2019s eyes, it is\\r\\nplain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\\r\\nthan he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale\\u2019s\\r\\neyes corresponds to that of a man\\u2019s ears; and you may fancy, for\\r\\nyourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\\r\\nthrough your ears. You would find that you could only command some\\r\\nthirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\\r\\nand about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\\r\\nstraight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\\r\\nbe able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\\r\\nbehind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\\r\\nsame time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the\\r\\nfront of a man\\u2014what, indeed, but his eyes?\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\\r\\nare so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\\r\\nproduce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\\r\\nthe whale\\u2019s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic\\r\\nfeet of solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain\\r\\nseparating two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate\\r\\nthe impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale,\\r\\ntherefore, must see one distinct picture on this side, and another\\r\\ndistinct picture on that side; while all between must be profound\\r\\ndarkness and nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out\\r\\non the world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window.\\r\\nBut with the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two\\r\\ndistinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and\\r\\nto be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\\r\\n\\r\\nA curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\\r\\nvisual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\\r\\nhint. So long as a man\\u2019s eyes are open in the light, the act of\\r\\nseeing is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\\r\\nwhatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one\\u2019s experience\\r\\nwill teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\\r\\nthings at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively,\\r\\nand completely, to examine any two things\\u2014however large or however\\r\\nsmall\\u2014at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side\\r\\nby side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\\r\\nobjects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\\r\\norder to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\\r\\nbear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\\r\\nconsciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes,\\r\\nin themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\\r\\ncomprehensive, combining, and subtle than man\\u2019s, that he can at the\\r\\nsame moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on\\r\\none side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If\\r\\nhe can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\\r\\nsimultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems\\r\\nin Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this\\r\\ncomparison.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\\r\\nextraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\\r\\nbeset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\\r\\nfrights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\\r\\nproceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\\r\\ndivided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\\r\\nentire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\\r\\nfor hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\\r\\nwhatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\\r\\nwondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\\r\\nrespect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\\r\\nbetween the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\\r\\nan external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\\r\\nover with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\\r\\nworld through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which\\r\\nis smaller than a hare\\u2019s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of\\r\\nHerschel\\u2019s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches\\r\\nof cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\\r\\nhearing? Not at all.\\u2014Why then do you try to \\u201cenlarge\\u201d your mind?\\r\\nSubtilize it.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand,\\r\\ncant over the sperm whale\\u2019s head, that it may lie bottom up; then,\\r\\nascending by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and\\r\\nwere it not that the body is now completely separated from it, with a\\r\\nlantern we might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his\\r\\nstomach. But let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where\\r\\nwe are. What a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor\\r\\nto ceiling, lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane,\\r\\nglossy as bridal satins.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\\r\\nlike the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one\\r\\nend, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\\r\\nand expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\\r\\nalas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\\r\\nspikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\\r\\nwhen fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\\r\\nsuspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\\r\\nstraight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\\r\\nship\\u2019s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\\r\\nsorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\\r\\njaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\\r\\nreproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn most cases this lower jaw\\u2014being easily unhinged by a practised\\r\\nartist\\u2014is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting\\r\\nthe ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone\\r\\nwith which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,\\r\\nincluding canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an\\r\\nanchor; and when the proper time comes\\u2014some few days after the other\\r\\nwork\\u2014Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,\\r\\nare set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances\\r\\nthe gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being\\r\\nrigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag\\r\\nstumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two\\r\\nteeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled\\r\\nafter our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs, and\\r\\npiled away like joists for building houses.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 75. The Right Whale\\u2019s Head\\u2014Contrasted View.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right\\r\\nWhale\\u2019s head.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in general shape the noble Sperm Whale\\u2019s head may be compared to a\\r\\nRoman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);\\r\\nso, at a broad view, the Right Whale\\u2019s head bears a rather inelegant\\r\\nresemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an\\r\\nold Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker\\u2019s last. And\\r\\nin this same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with\\r\\nthe swarming brood, might very comfortably be lodged, she and all her\\r\\nprogeny.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different\\r\\naspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and\\r\\nlook at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head\\r\\nfor an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in its\\r\\nsounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,\\r\\ncrested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass\\u2014this green,\\r\\nbarnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the \\u201ccrown,\\u201d and the\\r\\nSouthern fishers the \\u201cbonnet\\u201d of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes\\r\\nsolely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\\r\\nwith a bird\\u2019s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those\\r\\nlive crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost\\r\\nsure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the\\r\\ntechnical term \\u201ccrown\\u201d also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\\r\\ntake great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\\r\\ndiademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\\r\\nhim in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very\\r\\nsulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower lip!\\r\\nwhat a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter\\u2019s\\r\\nmeasurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a sulk and pout\\r\\nthat will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\\r\\n\\r\\nA great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.\\r\\nThe fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an\\r\\nimportant interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when earthquakes\\r\\ncaused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery threshold,\\r\\nwe now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at Mackinaw, I should\\r\\ntake this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good Lord! is this the\\r\\nroad that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a\\r\\npretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while\\r\\nthese ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us with those wondrous, half\\r\\nvertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone, say three hundred on a\\r\\nside, which depending from the upper part of the head or crown\\r\\nbone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily\\r\\nmentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres,\\r\\nthrough which the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose\\r\\nintricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes through\\r\\nthe seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of bone, as they\\r\\nstand in their natural order, there are certain curious marks, curves,\\r\\nhollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the creature\\u2019s\\r\\nage, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the certainty\\r\\nof this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the savor of\\r\\nanalogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we must grant\\r\\na far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance will seem\\r\\nreasonable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies\\r\\nconcerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous\\r\\n\\u201cwhiskers\\u201d inside of the whale\\u2019s mouth;* another, \\u201chogs\\u2019\\r\\nbristles\\u201d; a third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following\\r\\nelegant language: \\u201cThere are about two hundred and fifty fins growing\\r\\non each side of his upper chop, which arch over his tongue on each side\\r\\nof his mouth.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n*This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or\\r\\nrather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\\r\\nupper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these\\r\\ntufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn\\r\\ncountenance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs every one knows, these same \\u201chogs\\u2019 bristles,\\u201d \\u201cfins,\\u201d\\r\\n\\u201cwhiskers,\\u201d \\u201cblinds,\\u201d or whatever you please, furnish to the\\r\\nladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances. But in this\\r\\nparticular, the demand has long been on the decline. It was in Queen\\r\\nAnne\\u2019s time that the bone was in its glory, the farthingale being then\\r\\nall the fashion. And as those ancient dames moved about gaily, though\\r\\nin the jaws of the whale, as you may say; even so, in a shower, with\\r\\nthe like thoughtlessness, do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for\\r\\nprotection; the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and, standing\\r\\nin the Right Whale\\u2019s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all these\\r\\ncolonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not think\\r\\nyou were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its\\r\\nthousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest\\r\\nTurkey\\u2014the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the\\r\\nmouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting\\r\\nit on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I\\r\\nshould say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that\\r\\namount of oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started\\r\\nwith\\u2014that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely\\r\\ndifferent heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale\\u2019s there is no\\r\\ngreat well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of\\r\\na lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale\\u2019s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there\\r\\nany of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of\\r\\na tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm\\r\\nWhale only one.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie\\r\\ntogether; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will\\r\\nnot be very long in following.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale\\u2019s there? It is the\\r\\nsame he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead\\r\\nseem now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like\\r\\nplacidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark\\r\\nthe other head\\u2019s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by\\r\\naccident against the vessel\\u2019s side, so as firmly to embrace the\\r\\njaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical\\r\\nresolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a\\r\\nStoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in\\r\\nhis latter years.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale\\u2019s head, I would have\\r\\nyou, as a sensible physiologist, simply\\u2014particularly remark its front\\r\\naspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate\\r\\nit now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated,\\r\\nintelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged\\r\\nthere. Here is a vital point; for you must either satisfactorily settle\\r\\nthis matter with yourself, or for ever remain an infidel as to one of\\r\\nthe most appalling, but not the less true events, perhaps anywhere to be\\r\\nfound in all recorded history.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,\\r\\nthe front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the\\r\\nwater; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably\\r\\nbackwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which\\r\\nreceives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the mouth is entirely\\r\\nunder the head, much in the same way, indeed, as though your own mouth\\r\\nwere entirely under your chin. Moreover you observe that the whale has\\r\\nno external nose; and that what nose he has\\u2014his spout hole\\u2014is on the\\r\\ntop of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides\\r\\nof his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.\\r\\nWherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\u2019s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender\\r\\nprominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider\\r\\nthat only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of\\r\\nthe head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you\\r\\nget near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial\\r\\ndevelopment. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad.\\r\\nFinally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents partly comprise\\r\\nthe most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised of the nature of\\r\\nthe substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy.\\r\\nIn some previous place I have described to you how the blubber wraps the\\r\\nbody of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange. Just so with the head;\\r\\nbut with this difference: about the head this envelope, though not so\\r\\nthick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable by any man who has not\\r\\nhandled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by\\r\\nthe strongest human arm, impotently rebounds from it. It is as though\\r\\nthe forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved with horses\\u2019 hoofs. I do\\r\\nnot think that any sensation lurks in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen\\r\\nchance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the\\r\\nsailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming\\r\\ncontact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold\\r\\nthere a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest\\r\\nand toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which\\r\\nwould have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By\\r\\nitself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But\\r\\nsupplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that\\r\\nas ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,\\r\\ncapable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,\\r\\nas far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too,\\r\\nthe otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head\\r\\naltogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated out\\r\\nof the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope;\\r\\nconsidering the unique interior of his head; it has hypothetically\\r\\noccurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled honeycombs there\\r\\nmay possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with\\r\\nthe outer air, so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and\\r\\ncontraction. If this be so, fancy the irresistibleness of that might, to\\r\\nwhich the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable\\r\\nwall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a\\r\\nmass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood\\r\\nis\\u2014by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest\\r\\ninsect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the\\r\\nspecialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this\\r\\nexpansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more inconsiderable\\r\\nbraining feats; I trust you will have renounced all ignorant\\r\\nincredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the Sperm Whale\\r\\nstove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed the Atlantic\\r\\nwith the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your eye-brow. For\\r\\nunless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and sentimentalist\\r\\nin Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander giants only to\\r\\nencounter; how small the chances for the provincials then? What befell\\r\\nthe weakling youth lifting the dread goddess\\u2019s veil at Lais?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must\\r\\nknow something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated\\r\\nupon.\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the Sperm Whale\\u2019s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an\\r\\ninclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower\\r\\nis the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an\\r\\nunctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the\\r\\nexpanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the\\r\\nforehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two\\r\\nalmost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal\\r\\nwall of a thick tendinous substance.\\r\\n\\r\\n*Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical\\r\\nmathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a\\r\\nsolid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the\\r\\nsteep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both\\r\\nsides.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb\\r\\nof oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand\\r\\ninfiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole\\r\\nextent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great\\r\\nHeidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is\\r\\nmystically carved in front, so the whale\\u2019s vast plaited forehead\\r\\nforms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his\\r\\nwondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished\\r\\nwith the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun\\r\\nof the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages;\\r\\nnamely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure, limpid,\\r\\nand odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found unalloyed\\r\\nin any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains perfectly\\r\\nfluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon begins to\\r\\nconcrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when the first\\r\\nthin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale\\u2019s case\\r\\ngenerally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from\\r\\nunavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and\\r\\ndribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business\\r\\nof securing what you can.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun\\r\\nwas coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not\\r\\npossibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like\\r\\nthe lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\u2019s case.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale\\r\\nembraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since\\u2014as\\r\\nhas been elsewhere set forth\\u2014the head embraces one third of the whole\\r\\nlength of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet for\\r\\na good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the depth of\\r\\nthe tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ship\\u2019s\\r\\nside.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in decapitating the whale, the operator\\u2019s instrument is brought\\r\\nclose to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the\\r\\nspermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest a\\r\\ncareless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let\\r\\nout its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the head,\\r\\nalso, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in that\\r\\nposition by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen combinations, on\\r\\none side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous\\r\\nand\\u2014in this particular instance\\u2014almost fatal operation whereby the\\r\\nSperm Whale\\u2019s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.\\r\\n\\r\\nNimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect\\r\\nposture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the\\r\\npart where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried\\r\\nwith him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,\\r\\ntravelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that\\r\\nit hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it\\r\\nis caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down\\r\\nthe other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he\\r\\nlands on the summit of the head. There\\u2014still high elevated above\\r\\nthe rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries\\u2014he seems some\\r\\nTurkish Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a\\r\\ntower. A short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently\\r\\nsearches for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this\\r\\nbusiness he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old\\r\\nhouse, sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the\\r\\ntime this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely\\r\\nlike a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while\\r\\nthe other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or\\r\\nthree alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of\\r\\nthe Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.\\r\\nInserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the bucket\\r\\ninto the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word to\\r\\nthe seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like a\\r\\ndairy-maid\\u2019s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height,\\r\\nthe full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly\\r\\nemptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through\\r\\nthe same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the\\r\\nend, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper and\\r\\ndeeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;\\r\\nseveral tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once a\\r\\nqueer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian,\\r\\nwas so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed\\r\\nhold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the\\r\\nplace where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil\\r\\nOne himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular\\r\\nreasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden,\\r\\nas the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up\\u2014my God! poor\\r\\nTashtego\\u2014like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well,\\r\\ndropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with\\r\\na horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMan overboard!\\u201d cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation\\r\\nfirst came to his senses. \\u201cSwing the bucket this way!\\u201d and putting\\r\\none foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on\\r\\nthe whip itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head,\\r\\nalmost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime,\\r\\nthere was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before\\r\\nlifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,\\r\\nas if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only\\r\\nthe poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous\\r\\ndepth to which he had sunk.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing\\r\\nthe whip\\u2014which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles\\u2014a\\r\\nsharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,\\r\\none of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with\\r\\na vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship\\r\\nreeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,\\r\\nupon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be\\r\\non the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent\\r\\nmotions of the head.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome down, come down!\\u201d yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one\\r\\nhand holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop,\\r\\nhe would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,\\r\\nrammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the\\r\\nburied harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIn heaven\\u2019s name, man,\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201care you ramming home\\r\\na cartridge there?\\u2014Avast! How will that help him; jamming that\\r\\niron-bound bucket on top of his head? Avast, will ye!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStand clear of the tackle!\\u201d cried a voice like the bursting of a\\r\\nrocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass\\r\\ndropped into the sea, like Niagara\\u2019s Table-Rock into the whirlpool;\\r\\nthe suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her\\r\\nglittering copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging\\u2014now\\r\\nover the sailors\\u2019 heads, and now over the water\\u2014Daggoo, through a\\r\\nthick mist of spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles,\\r\\nwhile poor, buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom\\r\\nof the sea! But hardly had the blinding vapour cleared away, when a\\r\\nnaked figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment\\r\\nseen hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that\\r\\nmy brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to\\r\\nthe side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,\\r\\nand no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands\\r\\nnow jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHa! ha!\\u201d cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging\\r\\nperch overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm\\r\\nthrust upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm\\r\\nthrust forth from the grass over a grave.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBoth! both!\\u2014it is both!\\u201d\\u2014cried Daggoo again with a joyful\\r\\nshout; and soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one\\r\\nhand, and with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn\\r\\ninto the waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but\\r\\nTashtego was long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after\\r\\nthe slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made\\r\\nside lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\\r\\ndropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\\r\\nand so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\\r\\nthrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\\r\\nwas not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;\\u2014he had\\r\\nthrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\\r\\nsomerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\\r\\nthe good old way\\u2014head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\\r\\ndoing as well as could be expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,\\r\\nthe deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was successfully\\r\\naccomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and apparently\\r\\nhopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten.\\r\\nMidwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing,\\r\\nriding and rowing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header\\u2019s will be sure to\\r\\nseem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either\\r\\nseen or heard of some one\\u2019s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident\\r\\nwhich not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the\\r\\nIndian\\u2019s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the\\r\\nSperm Whale\\u2019s well.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought\\r\\nthe tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and\\r\\nmost corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of\\r\\na far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at\\r\\nall, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been\\r\\nnearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense\\r\\ntendinous wall of the well\\u2014a double welded, hammered substance, as I\\r\\nhave before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which\\r\\nsinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking in this\\r\\nsubstance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the\\r\\nother parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it sank\\r\\nvery slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair chance\\r\\nfor performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say. Yes, it\\r\\nwas a running delivery, so it was.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious\\r\\nperishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant\\r\\nspermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber\\r\\nand sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily\\r\\nbe recalled\\u2014the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking\\r\\nhoney in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it,\\r\\nthat leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed.\\r\\nHow many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato\\u2019s honey head, and\\r\\nsweetly perished there?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 79. The Prairie.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this\\r\\nLeviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has as\\r\\nyet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for\\r\\nLavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,\\r\\nor for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the\\r\\nPantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats\\r\\nof the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces\\r\\nof horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the\\r\\nmodifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and\\r\\nhis disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the\\r\\nphrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,\\r\\nthough I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of these\\r\\ntwo semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all things;\\r\\nI achieve what I can.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhysiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature.\\r\\nHe has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most\\r\\nconspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and\\r\\nfinally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that its\\r\\nentire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect\\r\\nthe countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,\\r\\ncupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable\\r\\nto the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in\\r\\nkeeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the nose\\r\\nfrom Phidias\\u2019s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder! Nevertheless,\\r\\nLeviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his proportions are so\\r\\nstately, that the same deficiency which in the sculptured Jove were\\r\\nhideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is an added grandeur. A\\r\\nnose to the whale would have been impertinent. As on your physiognomical\\r\\nvoyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly-boat, your noble\\r\\nconceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a\\r\\nnose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which so often will insist upon\\r\\nobtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to\\r\\nbe had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This\\r\\naspect is sublime.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the\\r\\nmorning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has a\\r\\ntouch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles, the\\r\\nelephant\\u2019s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is as\\r\\nthat great golden seal affixed by the German Emperors to their decrees.\\r\\nIt signifies\\u2014\\u201cGod: done this day by my hand.\\u201d But in most\\r\\ncreatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip\\r\\nof alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which\\r\\nlike Shakespeare\\u2019s or Melancthon\\u2019s rise so high, and descend so low,\\r\\nthat the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;\\r\\nand all above them in the forehead\\u2019s wrinkles, you seem to track the\\r\\nantlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters\\r\\ntrack the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this\\r\\nhigh and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely\\r\\namplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the\\r\\nDeity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other\\r\\nobject in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one\\r\\ndistinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;\\r\\nhe has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead,\\r\\npleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats, and ships,\\r\\nand men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish; though that\\r\\nway viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In profile, you\\r\\nplainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic depression in the\\r\\nforehead\\u2019s middle, which, in man, is Lavater\\u2019s mark of genius.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written\\r\\na book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his\\r\\ndoing nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his\\r\\npyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale\\r\\nbeen known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by\\r\\ntheir child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,\\r\\nbecause the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no\\r\\ntongue, or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of\\r\\nprotrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall lure\\r\\nback to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and livingly\\r\\nenthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now unhaunted\\r\\nhill; then be sure, exalted to Jove\\u2019s high seat, the great Sperm Whale\\r\\nshall lord it.\\r\\n\\r\\nChampollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there\\r\\nis no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man\\u2019s and every\\r\\nbeing\\u2019s face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a\\r\\npassing fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages,\\r\\ncould not read the simplest peasant\\u2019s face in its profounder and\\r\\nmore subtle meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful\\r\\nChaldee of the Sperm Whale\\u2019s brow? I but put that brow before you.\\r\\nRead it if you can.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 80. The Nut.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist his\\r\\nbrain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to square.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet\\r\\nin length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as\\r\\nthe side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level\\r\\nbase. But in life\\u2014as we have elsewhere seen\\u2014this inclined plane is\\r\\nangularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent\\r\\nmass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater\\r\\nto bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this\\r\\ncrater\\u2014in another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as\\r\\nmany in depth\\u2014reposes the mere handful of this monster\\u2019s brain. The\\r\\nbrain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is\\r\\nhidden away behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within\\r\\nthe amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it\\r\\nsecreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny\\r\\nthat the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance\\r\\nof one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in strange\\r\\nfolds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it seems more\\r\\nin keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part\\r\\nof him as the seat of his intelligence.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in\\r\\nthe creature\\u2019s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his\\r\\ntrue brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The\\r\\nwhale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the common\\r\\nworld.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view\\r\\nof its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its\\r\\nresemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from\\r\\nthe same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down\\r\\nto the human magnitude) among a plate of men\\u2019s skulls, and you would\\r\\ninvoluntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on\\r\\none part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say\\u2014This\\r\\nman had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,\\r\\nconsidered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and\\r\\npower, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most\\r\\nexhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if from the comparative dimensions of the whale\\u2019s proper brain,\\r\\nyou deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another\\r\\nidea for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped\\u2019s spine,\\r\\nyou will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebrae to a strung\\r\\nnecklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the\\r\\nskull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebrae are absolutely\\r\\nundeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it\\r\\nthe Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once\\r\\npointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with\\r\\nthe vertebrae of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the\\r\\nbeaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have\\r\\nomitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from\\r\\nthe cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of\\r\\na man\\u2019s character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would\\r\\nrather feel your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of\\r\\na spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine,\\r\\nas in the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to\\r\\nthe world.\\r\\n\\r\\nApply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial\\r\\ncavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra\\r\\nthe bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being\\r\\neight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As\\r\\nit passes through the remaining vertebrae the canal tapers in size, but\\r\\nfor a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of\\r\\ncourse, this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous\\r\\nsubstance\\u2014the spinal cord\\u2014as the brain; and directly communicates\\r\\nwith the brain. And what is still more, for many feet after emerging\\r\\nfrom the brain\\u2019s cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing\\r\\ngirth, almost equal to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances,\\r\\nwould it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whale\\u2019s spine\\r\\nphrenologically? For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative\\r\\nsmallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful\\r\\ncomparative magnitude of his spinal cord.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I\\r\\nwould merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the\\r\\nSperm Whale\\u2019s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over\\r\\none of the larger vertebrae, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer\\r\\nconvex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call this\\r\\nhigh hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm Whale.\\r\\nAnd that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have reason to\\r\\nknow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau, Derick\\r\\nDe Deer, master, of Bremen.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and\\r\\nGermans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide\\r\\nintervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with\\r\\ntheir flag in the Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.\\r\\nWhile yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a\\r\\nboat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the\\r\\nbows instead of the stern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat has he in his hand there?\\u201d cried Starbuck, pointing\\r\\nto something wavingly held by the German. \\u201cImpossible!\\u2014a\\r\\nlamp-feeder!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNot that,\\u201d said Stubb, \\u201cno, no, it\\u2019s a coffee-pot, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck; he\\u2019s coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman;\\r\\ndon\\u2019t you see that big tin can there alongside of him?\\u2014that\\u2019s his\\r\\nboiling water. Oh! he\\u2019s all right, is the Yarman.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGo along with you,\\u201d cried Flask, \\u201cit\\u2019s a lamp-feeder and an\\r\\noil-can. He\\u2019s out of oil, and has come a-begging.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the\\r\\nwhale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old\\r\\nproverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing\\r\\nreally happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did\\r\\nindubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all\\r\\nheeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German\\r\\nsoon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately\\r\\nturning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some\\r\\nremarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in\\r\\nprofound darkness\\u2014his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a\\r\\nsingle flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding\\r\\nby hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically\\r\\ncalled a clean one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name of\\r\\nJungfrau or the Virgin.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his\\r\\nship\\u2019s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the\\r\\nmast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that\\r\\nwithout pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed\\r\\nround his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German\\r\\nboats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the\\r\\nPequod\\u2019s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of\\r\\ntheir danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight\\r\\nbefore the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of\\r\\nhorses in harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually\\r\\nunrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nFull in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,\\r\\nhumped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as\\r\\nby the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed afflicted\\r\\nwith the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this whale belonged\\r\\nto the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is not customary for\\r\\nsuch venerable leviathans to be at all social. Nevertheless, he stuck\\r\\nto their wake, though indeed their back water must have retarded him,\\r\\nbecause the white-bone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one,\\r\\nlike the swell formed when two hostile currents meet. His spout was\\r\\nshort, slow, and laborious; coming forth with a choking sort of gush,\\r\\nand spending itself in torn shreds, followed by strange subterranean\\r\\ncommotions in him, which seemed to have egress at his other buried\\r\\nextremity, causing the waters behind him to upbubble.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho\\u2019s got some paregoric?\\u201d said Stubb, \\u201che has the\\r\\nstomach-ache, I\\u2019m afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of\\r\\nstomach-ache! Adverse winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys.\\r\\nIt\\u2019s the first foul wind I ever knew to blow from astern; but look,\\r\\ndid ever whale yaw so before? it must be, he\\u2019s lost his tiller.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck\\r\\nload of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her\\r\\nway; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly\\r\\nturning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious\\r\\nwake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost\\r\\nthat fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOnly wait a bit, old chap, and I\\u2019ll give ye a sling for that\\r\\nwounded arm,\\u201d cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMind he don\\u2019t sling thee with it,\\u201d cried Starbuck. \\u201cGive way,\\r\\nor the German will have him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWith one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this\\r\\none fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most\\r\\nvaluable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were\\r\\ngoing with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for\\r\\nthe time. At this juncture the Pequod\\u2019s keels had shot by the\\r\\nthree German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,\\r\\nDerick\\u2019s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his\\r\\nforeign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being already\\r\\nso nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron before they\\r\\ncould completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he seemed quite\\r\\nconfident that this would be the case, and occasionally with a deriding\\r\\ngesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe ungracious and ungrateful dog!\\u201d cried Starbuck; \\u201che mocks\\r\\nand dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes\\r\\nago!\\u201d\\u2014then in his old intense whisper\\u2014\\u201cGive way, greyhounds! Dog\\r\\nto it!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI tell ye what it is, men\\u201d\\u2014cried Stubb to his crew\\u2014\\u201cit\\u2019s\\r\\nagainst my religion to get mad; but I\\u2019d like to eat that villainous\\r\\nYarman\\u2014Pull\\u2014won\\u2019t ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do\\r\\nye love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why\\r\\ndon\\u2019t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who\\u2019s that been dropping an\\r\\nanchor overboard\\u2014we don\\u2019t budge an inch\\u2014we\\u2019re becalmed. Halloo,\\r\\nhere\\u2019s grass growing in the boat\\u2019s bottom\\u2014and by the Lord, the\\r\\nmast there\\u2019s budding. This won\\u2019t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The\\r\\nshort and long of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! see the suds he makes!\\u201d cried Flask, dancing up and\\r\\ndown\\u2014\\u201cWhat a hump\\u2014Oh, do pile on the beef\\u2014lays like a log! Oh!\\r\\nmy lads, do spring\\u2014slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my\\r\\nlads\\u2014baked clams and muffins\\u2014oh, do, do, spring,\\u2014he\\u2019s a hundred\\r\\nbarreller\\u2014don\\u2019t lose him now\\u2014don\\u2019t oh, don\\u2019t!\\u2014see that\\r\\nYarman\\u2014Oh, won\\u2019t ye pull for your duff, my lads\\u2014such a sog! such\\r\\na sogger! Don\\u2019t ye love sperm? There goes three thousand dollars,\\r\\nmen!\\u2014a bank!\\u2014a whole bank! The bank of England!\\u2014Oh, do, do,\\r\\ndo!\\u2014What\\u2019s that Yarman about now?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the\\r\\nadvancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view\\r\\nof retarding his rivals\\u2019 way, and at the same time economically\\r\\naccelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe unmannerly Dutch dogger!\\u201d cried Stubb. \\u201cPull now, men, like\\r\\nfifty thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils.\\r\\nWhat d\\u2019ye say, Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in\\r\\ntwo-and-twenty pieces for the honour of old Gayhead? What d\\u2019ye say?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI say, pull like god-dam,\\u201d\\u2014cried the Indian.\\r\\n\\r\\nFiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\nthree boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,\\r\\nmomentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of\\r\\nthe headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\\r\\nproudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry\\r\\nof, \\u201cThere she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down with\\r\\nthe Yarman! Sail over him!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all\\r\\ntheir gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not\\r\\na righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade\\r\\nof his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to free\\r\\nhis white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick\\u2019s boat was nigh to\\r\\ncapsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;\\u2014that\\r\\nwas a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took\\r\\na mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German\\u2019s\\r\\nquarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was\\r\\nthe foaming swell that he made.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\\r\\nnow going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\\r\\ntormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\\r\\nfright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight,\\r\\nand still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the\\r\\nsea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I\\r\\nseen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the\\r\\nair, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a\\r\\nvoice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear\\r\\nof this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him;\\r\\nhe had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle,\\r\\nand this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his\\r\\namazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to\\r\\nappal the stoutest man who so pitied.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\nboats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick\\r\\nchose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart,\\r\\nere the last chance would for ever escape.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three\\r\\ntigers\\u2014Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo\\u2014instinctively sprang to their\\r\\nfeet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their\\r\\nbarbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their\\r\\nthree Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapours of foam and\\r\\nwhite-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale\\u2019s headlong\\r\\nrush, bumped the German\\u2019s aside with such force, that both Derick and\\r\\nhis baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three\\r\\nflying keels.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDon\\u2019t be afraid, my butter-boxes,\\u201d cried Stubb, casting a passing\\r\\nglance upon them as he shot by; \\u201cye\\u2019ll be picked up presently\\u2014all\\r\\nright\\u2014I saw some sharks astern\\u2014St. Bernard\\u2019s dogs, you\\r\\nknow\\u2014relieve distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail\\r\\nnow. Every keel a sunbeam! Hurrah!\\u2014Here we go like three tin kettles\\r\\nat the tail of a mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an\\r\\nelephant in a tilbury on a plain\\u2014makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys,\\r\\nwhen you fasten to him that way; and there\\u2019s danger of being pitched\\r\\nout too, when you strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels\\r\\nwhen he\\u2019s going to Davy Jones\\u2014all a rush down an endless inclined\\r\\nplane! Hurrah! this whale carries the everlasting mail!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the monster\\u2019s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\\r\\ntumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\\r\\nthe loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\\r\\nwhile so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\\r\\nsoon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\\r\\ncaught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\\r\\nlast\\u2014owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\\r\\nthe boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue\\u2014the\\r\\ngunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\\r\\nsterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound,\\r\\nfor some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\\r\\nline, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\\r\\nbeen taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this \\u201cholding on,\\u201d\\r\\nas it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh\\r\\nfrom the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon\\r\\nrising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak\\r\\nof the peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is\\r\\nalways the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer\\r\\nthe stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,\\r\\nowing to the enormous surface of him\\u2014in a full grown sperm whale\\r\\nsomething less than 2000 square feet\\u2014the pressure of the water is\\r\\nimmense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves\\r\\nstand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the\\r\\nburden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms\\r\\nof ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One\\r\\nwhaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships,\\r\\nwith all their guns, and stores, and men on board.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\\r\\ninto its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\\r\\nsort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;\\r\\nwhat landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and\\r\\nplacidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\\r\\nagony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.\\r\\nSeems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\\r\\nwas suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and\\r\\nto what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was\\r\\nonce so triumphantly said\\u2014\\u201cCanst thou fill his skin with barbed\\r\\nirons? or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him\\r\\ncannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron\\r\\nas straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;\\r\\nhe laugheth at the shaking of a spear!\\u201d This the creature? this he?\\r\\nOh! that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength\\r\\nof a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\\r\\nmountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod\\u2019s fish-spears!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats\\r\\nsent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad\\r\\nenough to shade half Xerxes\\u2019 army. Who can tell how appalling to the\\r\\nwounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStand by, men; he stirs,\\u201d cried Starbuck, as the three lines\\r\\nsuddenly vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them,\\r\\nas by magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that\\r\\nevery oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great\\r\\npart from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden\\r\\nbounce upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white\\r\\nbears are scared from it into the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHaul in! Haul in!\\u201d cried Starbuck again; \\u201che\\u2019s rising.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand\\u2019s breadth\\r\\ncould have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\\r\\ndripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\\r\\nship\\u2019s lengths of the hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals\\r\\nthere are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby\\r\\nwhen wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in\\r\\ncertain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities\\r\\nit is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so\\r\\nthat when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly\\r\\ndrain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is\\r\\nheightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance\\r\\nbelow the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant\\r\\nstreams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant\\r\\nand numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and\\r\\nbleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will\\r\\nflow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible\\r\\nhills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously\\r\\ndrew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him,\\r\\nthey were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\\r\\ncontinually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only\\r\\nat intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the\\r\\nair. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him\\r\\nhad thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was\\r\\nuntouched.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\\r\\nhis form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\\r\\nrevealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\\r\\nbeheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\\r\\nnoblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale\\u2019s eyes\\r\\nhad once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\\r\\nBut pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\\r\\nblind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the\\r\\ngay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the\\r\\nsolemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all.\\r\\nStill rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely\\r\\ndiscoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the\\r\\nflank.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA nice spot,\\u201d cried Flask; \\u201cjust let me prick him there once.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast!\\u201d cried Starbuck, \\u201cthere\\u2019s no need of that!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\\r\\nulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than\\r\\nsufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury\\r\\nblindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews\\r\\nall over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask\\u2019s boat and marring the\\r\\nbows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by\\r\\nloss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\\r\\nmade; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\\r\\nthen over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up\\r\\nthe white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\\r\\npiteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water\\r\\nis gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\\r\\nmelancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\\r\\nground\\u2014so the last long dying spout of the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\\r\\nshowed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,\\r\\nby Starbuck\\u2019s orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so\\r\\nthat ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a\\r\\nfew inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when\\r\\nthe ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was\\r\\nstrongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain\\r\\nthat unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the\\r\\nbottom.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\\r\\nthe entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh,\\r\\non the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of\\r\\nharpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales,\\r\\nwith the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any\\r\\nkind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been\\r\\nsome other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\\r\\nthe ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\\r\\nlance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\\r\\nthe flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\\r\\nwhen? It might have been darted by some Nor\\u2019 West Indian long before\\r\\nAmerica was discovered.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\\r\\ncabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\\r\\ndiscoveries, by the ship\\u2019s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\\r\\nto the sea, owing to the body\\u2019s immensely increasing tendency to sink.\\r\\nHowever, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the\\r\\nlast; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship\\r\\nwould have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the\\r\\nbody; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was\\r\\nthe immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and\\r\\ncables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime\\r\\neverything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the\\r\\ndeck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship\\r\\ngroaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and\\r\\ncabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation.\\r\\nIn vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable\\r\\nfluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low\\r\\nhad the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all\\r\\napproached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to\\r\\nthe sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHold on, hold on, won\\u2019t ye?\\u201d cried Stubb to the body, \\u201cdon\\u2019t\\r\\nbe in such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do\\r\\nsomething or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your\\r\\nhandspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut\\r\\nthe big chains.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cKnife? Aye, aye,\\u201d cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter\\u2019s\\r\\nheavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began\\r\\nslashing at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks,\\r\\nwere given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\\r\\nsnap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\\r\\nWhale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\\r\\naccounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\\r\\nbuoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\\r\\nsurface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\\r\\nbroken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\\r\\nbones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\\r\\nthis sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\\r\\nsinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\\r\\nis not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\\r\\nnoble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\\r\\nlife, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant\\r\\nheroes do sometimes sink.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\\r\\naccident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\\r\\nRight Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in\\r\\nno small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\\r\\nhis Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\\r\\nincumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\\r\\nwhere, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\\r\\nagain rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this\\r\\nis obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\\r\\nmagnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could\\r\\nhardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among\\r\\nthe Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they\\r\\nfasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone\\r\\ndown, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard\\r\\nfrom the Pequod\\u2019s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was\\r\\nagain lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a\\r\\nFin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of\\r\\nits incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back\\u2019s spout\\r\\nis so similar to the Sperm Whale\\u2019s, that by unskilful fishermen it is\\r\\noften mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now\\r\\nin valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail,\\r\\nmade after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to\\r\\nleeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 82. The Honour and Glory of Whaling.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the true\\r\\nmethod.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up\\r\\nto the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its\\r\\ngreat honourableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many\\r\\ngreat demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other\\r\\nhave shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection\\r\\nthat I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a\\r\\nfraternity.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and\\r\\nto the eternal honour of our calling be it said, that the first whale\\r\\nattacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent. Those\\r\\nwere the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms to\\r\\nsuccor the distressed, and not to fill men\\u2019s lamp-feeders. Every one\\r\\nknows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda,\\r\\nthe daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as\\r\\nLeviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince\\r\\nof whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered\\r\\nand married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely\\r\\nachieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this\\r\\nLeviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this\\r\\nArkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast,\\r\\nin one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton\\r\\nof a whale, which the city\\u2019s legends and all the inhabitants asserted\\r\\nto be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the\\r\\nRomans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph.\\r\\nWhat seems most singular and suggestively important in this story, is\\r\\nthis: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.\\r\\n\\r\\nAkin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda\\u2014indeed, by some\\r\\nsupposed to be indirectly derived from it\\u2014is that famous story of St.\\r\\nGeorge and the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale;\\r\\nfor in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled\\r\\ntogether, and often stand for each other. \\u201cThou art as a lion of the\\r\\nwaters, and as a dragon of the sea,\\u201d saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly\\r\\nmeaning a whale; in truth, some versions of the Bible use that word\\r\\nitself. Besides, it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit\\r\\nhad St. George but encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead\\r\\nof doing battle with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill\\r\\na snake, but only a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in\\r\\nthem to march boldly up to a whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though\\r\\nthe creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely\\r\\nrepresented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted\\r\\non land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance\\r\\nof those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;\\r\\nand considering that as in Perseus\\u2019 case, St. George\\u2019s whale might\\r\\nhave crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that\\r\\nthe animal ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal,\\r\\nor sea-horse; bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether\\r\\nincompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the\\r\\nscene, to hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan\\r\\nhimself. In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this\\r\\nwhole story will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the\\r\\nPhilistines, Dagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel,\\r\\nhis horse\\u2019s head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him,\\r\\nand only the stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our\\r\\nown noble stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England;\\r\\nand by good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in\\r\\nthe most noble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights\\r\\nof that honourable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever\\r\\nhad to do with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a\\r\\nNantucketer with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred\\r\\ntrowsers we are much better entitled to St. George\\u2019s decoration than\\r\\nthey.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long\\r\\nremained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that\\r\\nantique Crockett and Kit Carson\\u2014that brawny doer of rejoicing good\\r\\ndeeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether\\r\\nthat strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere\\r\\nappears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed,\\r\\nfrom the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary\\r\\nwhaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I\\r\\nclaim him for one of our clan.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of\\r\\nHercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more\\r\\nancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versa; certainly\\r\\nthey are very similar. If I claim the demigod then, why not the prophet?\\r\\n\\r\\nNor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole\\r\\nroll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal\\r\\nkings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing\\r\\nshort of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now\\r\\nto be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one\\r\\nof the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine\\r\\nVishnoo himself for our Lord;\\u2014Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten\\r\\nearthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.\\r\\nWhen Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved to recreate\\r\\nthe world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave birth to\\r\\nVishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical books,\\r\\nwhose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo before\\r\\nbeginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained\\r\\nsomething in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these\\r\\nVedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became\\r\\nincarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,\\r\\nrescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even\\r\\nas a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there\\u2019s a\\r\\nmember-roll for you! What club but the whaleman\\u2019s can head off like\\r\\nthat?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.\\r\\n\\r\\nReference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in the\\r\\npreceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical\\r\\nstory of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks\\r\\nand Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times,\\r\\nequally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the\\r\\ndolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those\\r\\ntraditions one whit the less facts, for all that.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne old Sag-Harbor whaleman\\u2019s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\\r\\nstory was this:\\u2014He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\\r\\nembellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\\r\\nJonah\\u2019s whale with two spouts in his head\\u2014a peculiarity only true\\r\\nwith respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the\\r\\nvarieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this\\r\\nsaying, \\u201cA penny roll would choke him\\u201d; his swallow is so very\\r\\nsmall. But, to this, Bishop Jebb\\u2019s anticipative answer is ready. It is\\r\\nnot necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth.\\r\\nAnd this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the\\r\\nRight Whale\\u2019s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables,\\r\\nand comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have\\r\\nensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right\\r\\nWhale is toothless.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\\r\\nwant of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\\r\\nreference to his incarcerated body and the whale\\u2019s gastric juices. But\\r\\nthis objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\\r\\nsupposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\\r\\ndead whale\\u2014even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\\r\\ntheir dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has\\r\\nbeen divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was\\r\\nthrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape\\r\\nto another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head;\\r\\nand, I would add, possibly called \\u201cThe Whale,\\u201d as some craft are\\r\\nnowadays christened the \\u201cShark,\\u201d the \\u201cGull,\\u201d the \\u201cEagle.\\u201d\\r\\nNor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the\\r\\nwhale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver\\u2014an\\r\\ninflated bag of wind\\u2014which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was\\r\\nsaved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all\\r\\nround. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was\\r\\nthis, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the\\r\\nMediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere\\r\\nwithin three days\\u2019 journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much\\r\\nmore than three days\\u2019 journey across from the nearest point of the\\r\\nMediterranean coast. How is that?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that\\r\\nshort distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the\\r\\nway of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through\\r\\nthe whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the\\r\\nPersian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete\\r\\ncircumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris\\r\\nwaters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to\\r\\nswim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah\\u2019s weathering the Cape of Good\\r\\nHope at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that\\r\\ngreat headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so\\r\\nmake modern history a liar.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\\r\\nfoolish pride of reason\\u2014a thing still more reprehensible in him,\\r\\nseeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from\\r\\nthe sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride,\\r\\nand abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a\\r\\nPortuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah\\u2019s going to Nineveh\\r\\nvia the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of\\r\\nthe general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly\\r\\nenlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.\\r\\nAnd some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris\\u2019s\\r\\nVoyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honour of Jonah, in which\\r\\nMosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are\\r\\nanointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an\\r\\nanalogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it\\r\\nto be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly\\r\\nbe of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are\\r\\nhostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to\\r\\nmake the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing\\r\\nhis boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau\\r\\ndisappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation; crawling\\r\\nunder its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in the\\r\\nunctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from\\r\\nthe craft\\u2019s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to some\\r\\nparticular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the event.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to\\r\\nthem, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered flight,\\r\\nas of Cleopatra\\u2019s barges from Actium.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb\\u2019s was foremost. By great\\r\\nexertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the\\r\\nstricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal\\r\\nflight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the\\r\\nplanted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became\\r\\nimperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But\\r\\nto haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and\\r\\nfurious. What then remained?\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and\\r\\ncountless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,\\r\\nnone exceed that fine manoeuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small\\r\\nsword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It\\r\\nis only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand\\r\\nfact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is\\r\\naccurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme\\r\\nheadway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or twelve\\r\\nfeet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon,\\r\\nand also of a lighter material\\u2014pine. It is furnished with a small rope\\r\\ncalled a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be hauled back to\\r\\nthe hand after darting.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut before going further, it is important to mention here, that though\\r\\nthe harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it\\r\\nis seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful,\\r\\non account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\\r\\ncompared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a\\r\\ngeneral thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any\\r\\npitchpoling comes into play.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\\r\\nequanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel\\r\\nin pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the\\r\\nflying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet ahead.\\r\\nHandling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along its\\r\\nlength to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers up\\r\\nthe coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in his\\r\\ngrasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full before\\r\\nhis waistband\\u2019s middle, he levels it at the whale; when, covering\\r\\nhim with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby\\r\\nelevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his\\r\\npalm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\\r\\nbalancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless\\r\\nimpulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\\r\\ndistance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of\\r\\nsparkling water, he now spouts red blood.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat drove the spigot out of him!\\u201d cried Stubb. \\u201c\\u2018Tis July\\u2019s\\r\\nimmortal Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were\\r\\nold Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,\\r\\nTashtego, lad, I\\u2019d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we\\u2019d drink\\r\\nround it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we\\u2019d brew choice punch in the\\r\\nspread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the\\r\\nliving stuff.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,\\r\\nthe spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful\\r\\nleash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is\\r\\nslackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and\\r\\nmutely watches the monster die.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 85. The Fountain.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat for six thousand years\\u2014and no one knows how many millions of ages\\r\\nbefore\\u2014the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea,\\r\\nand sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so\\r\\nmany sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,\\r\\nthousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the\\r\\nwhale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings\\u2014that all this should\\r\\nbe, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter\\r\\nminutes past one o\\u2019clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.\\r\\n1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,\\r\\nafter all, really water, or nothing but vapour\\u2014this is surely a\\r\\nnoteworthy thing.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items\\r\\ncontingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their\\r\\ngills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is\\r\\ncombined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod\\r\\nmight live a century, and never once raise its head above the surface.\\r\\nBut owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular\\r\\nlungs, like a human being\\u2019s, the whale can only live by inhaling the\\r\\ndisengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for\\r\\nhis periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot in any degree\\r\\nbreathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm\\r\\nWhale\\u2019s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface; and\\r\\nwhat is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth. No, he\\r\\nbreathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the top of his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function\\r\\nindispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a\\r\\ncertain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the\\r\\nblood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I\\r\\nshall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.\\r\\nAssume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be\\r\\naerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not\\r\\nfetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\\r\\nlive without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\\r\\ncase with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\\r\\nhour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\\r\\nso much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\\r\\nno gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\\r\\nhe is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\\r\\nvermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\\r\\ncompletely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more,\\r\\na thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in\\r\\nhim, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus\\r\\nsupply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs.\\r\\nThe anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the\\r\\nsupposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more\\r\\ncogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of\\r\\nthat leviathan in having his spoutings out, as the fishermen phrase\\r\\nit. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the\\r\\nSperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform\\r\\nwith all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and\\r\\njets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\\r\\nrises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to\\r\\na minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that\\r\\nhe sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular\\r\\nallowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he\\r\\nfinally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that\\r\\nin different individuals these rates are different; but in any one\\r\\nthey are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his\\r\\nspoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere\\r\\ndescending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For\\r\\nnot by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing\\r\\na thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O\\r\\nhunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn man, breathing is incessantly going on\\u2014one breath only serving\\r\\nfor two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\\r\\nattend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\\r\\nSperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if\\r\\nit could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then\\r\\nI opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell\\r\\nseems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all\\r\\nanswers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged\\r\\nwith two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of\\r\\nsmelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout\\u2014whether it be water or\\r\\nwhether it be vapour\\u2014no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on\\r\\nthis head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper\\r\\nolfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no\\r\\nCologne-water in the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\\r\\ncanal, and as that long canal\\u2014like the grand Erie Canal\\u2014is furnished\\r\\nwith a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\\r\\nair or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\\r\\nunless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles,\\r\\nhe talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\\r\\nSeldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to\\r\\nthis world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\\r\\nliving. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it\\r\\nis for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\\r\\nhorizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\\r\\nto one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\\r\\nin a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether this\\r\\ngas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the\\r\\nSperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath, or whether that\\r\\nexhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\\r\\ndischarged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly\\r\\ncommunicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this\\r\\nis for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because\\r\\nthe greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he\\r\\naccidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale\\u2019s food is far beneath\\r\\nthe surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if\\r\\nyou regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find\\r\\nthat when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods\\r\\nof his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\\r\\nYou have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\\r\\ntell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\\r\\nsettle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\\r\\nknottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in\\r\\nit, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\\r\\nit; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\\r\\nwhen, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\\r\\nof his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading\\r\\nall around him. And if at such times you should think that you really\\r\\nperceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\\r\\nnot merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know that they\\r\\nare not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\\r\\nfissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale\\u2019s head? For\\r\\neven when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\\r\\nhis elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary\\u2019s in the desert; even then,\\r\\nthe whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under\\r\\na blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\\r\\nrain.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\\r\\nprecise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\\r\\ninto it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\\r\\nthis fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\\r\\nslight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the jet, which will\\r\\noften happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\\r\\nthe thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\\r\\ncontact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view,\\r\\nor otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\\r\\nWherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\\r\\nevade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\\r\\nit, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.\\r\\nThe wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let\\r\\nthis deadly spout alone.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\\r\\nhypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\\r\\nother reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\\r\\ntouching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;\\r\\nI account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\\r\\nfact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\\r\\nwhales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\\r\\nconvinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\\r\\nPlato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\\r\\nup a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\\r\\nthoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\\r\\ncuriosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there,\\r\\na curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my\\r\\nhead. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought,\\r\\nafter six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon;\\r\\nthis seems an additional argument for the above supposition.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\\r\\nbehold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\\r\\nhead overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his incommunicable\\r\\ncontemplations, and that vapour\\u2014as you will sometimes see\\r\\nit\\u2014glorified by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon\\r\\nhis thoughts. For, d\\u2019ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they\\r\\nonly irradiate vapour. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim\\r\\ndoubts in my mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my\\r\\nfog with a heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts;\\r\\nmany deny; but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions.\\r\\nDoubts of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly;\\r\\nthis combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who\\r\\nregards them both with equal eye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 86. The Tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\\r\\nand the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I\\r\\ncelebrate a tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nReckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale\\u2019s tail to begin at that point\\r\\nof the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\\r\\nupon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The\\r\\ncompact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms\\r\\nor flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness.\\r\\nAt the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways\\r\\nrecede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In\\r\\nno living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in\\r\\nthe crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the\\r\\nfull grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\\r\\ninto it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:\\u2014upper,\\r\\nmiddle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\\r\\nlong and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\\r\\ncrosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\\r\\nanything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\\r\\nwalls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\\r\\ncourse of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\\r\\nrelics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\\r\\ngreat strength of the masonry.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\\r\\nthe whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\\r\\nmuscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\\r\\nand running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\\r\\nlargely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\\r\\nmeasureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\\r\\nCould annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor does this\\u2014its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the\\r\\ngraceful flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates\\r\\nthrough a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their\\r\\nmost appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty\\r\\nor harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly\\r\\nbeautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied\\r\\ntendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved\\r\\nHercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the\\r\\nlinen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the\\r\\nmassive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When\\r\\nAngelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what robustness is\\r\\nthere. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the\\r\\nsoft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has\\r\\nbeen most successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they\\r\\nare of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative,\\r\\nfeminine one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is\\r\\nconceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\\r\\nwielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\\r\\nbe in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no\\r\\nfairy\\u2019s arm can transcend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFive great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\\r\\nprogression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\\r\\nFourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan\\u2019s tail acts in\\r\\na different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\\r\\nwriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\\r\\nwhale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\\r\\nforwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this\\r\\nwhich gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when\\r\\nfuriously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\\r\\nfights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\\r\\nconflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\\r\\nstriking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\\r\\nblow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\\r\\nair, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\\r\\nirresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\\r\\nsalvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\\r\\nopposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale\\r\\nboat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed\\r\\nplank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most\\r\\nserious result. These submerged side blows are so often received in the\\r\\nfishery, that they are accounted mere child\\u2019s play. Some one strips\\r\\noff a frock, and the hole is stopped.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\\r\\nthe sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\\r\\nthere is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\\r\\nelephant\\u2019s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\\r\\nsweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\\r\\nslowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of\\r\\nthe sea; and if he feel but a sailor\\u2019s whisker, woe to that sailor,\\r\\nwhiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\\r\\nHad this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\\r\\nDarmonodes\\u2019 elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with\\r\\nlow salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\\r\\nzones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\\r\\npossess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\\r\\nanother elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk\\r\\nand extracted the dart.\\r\\n\\r\\nFourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\\r\\nmiddle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\\r\\nof his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\\r\\nhearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of\\r\\nhis tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\\r\\nthunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great\\r\\ngun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour\\r\\nfrom the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was\\r\\nthe smoke from the touch-hole.\\r\\n\\r\\nFifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\\r\\nlie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\\r\\nout of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\\r\\nthe deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\\r\\ntossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\\r\\ndownwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime breach\\u2014somewhere\\r\\nelse to be described\\u2014this peaking of the whale\\u2019s flukes is perhaps\\r\\nthe grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the\\r\\nbottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching\\r\\nat the highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan\\r\\nthrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of\\r\\nHell. But in gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you\\r\\nare in; if in the Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of\\r\\nIsaiah, the archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a\\r\\nsunrise that crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales\\r\\nin the east, all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in\\r\\nconcert with peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand\\r\\nembodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia,\\r\\nthe home of the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of\\r\\nthe African elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him\\r\\nthe most devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military\\r\\nelephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks\\r\\nuplifted in the profoundest silence.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\\r\\nelephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\\r\\nof the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two\\r\\nopposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\\r\\nrespectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to\\r\\nLeviathan, so, compared with Leviathan\\u2019s tail, his trunk is but the\\r\\nstalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant\\u2019s trunk were\\r\\nas the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush\\r\\nand crash of the sperm whale\\u2019s ponderous flukes, which in repeated\\r\\ninstances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their\\r\\noars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his\\r\\nballs.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale\\r\\nand the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the\\r\\nelephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to\\r\\nthe elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of curious\\r\\nsimilitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the elephant\\r\\nwill often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then elevating it,\\r\\njet it forth in a stream.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my inability\\r\\nto express it. At times there are gestures in it, which, though they\\r\\nwould well grace the hand of man, remain wholly inexplicable. In an\\r\\nextensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are these mystic gestures,\\r\\nthat I have heard hunters who have declared them akin to Free-Mason\\r\\nsigns and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these methods\\r\\nintelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting other\\r\\nmotions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness, and\\r\\nunaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I may,\\r\\nthen, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I know\\r\\nnot even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much more,\\r\\nhow comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my back\\r\\nparts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen. But I\\r\\ncannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will about\\r\\nhis face, I say again he has no face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from\\r\\nthe territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.\\r\\nIn a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of\\r\\nSumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a\\r\\nvast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia,\\r\\nand dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded\\r\\noriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports\\r\\nfor the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the\\r\\nstraits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels\\r\\nbound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing\\r\\nmidway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green\\r\\npromontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond\\r\\nto the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and\\r\\nconsidering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,\\r\\nand gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental\\r\\nsea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such\\r\\ntreasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the\\r\\nappearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping\\r\\nwestern world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied\\r\\nwith those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the\\r\\nMediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these\\r\\nOrientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from\\r\\nthe endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries\\r\\npast, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra\\r\\nand Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while\\r\\nthey freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce\\r\\ntheir claim to more solid tribute.\\r\\n\\r\\nTime out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among\\r\\nthe low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the\\r\\nvessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the\\r\\npoint of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they\\r\\nhave received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these\\r\\ncorsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present\\r\\nday, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in\\r\\nthose waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these\\r\\nstraits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and\\r\\nthence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here and\\r\\nthere by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands, and\\r\\ngain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season there.\\r\\nBy these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost all the\\r\\nknown Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to descending\\r\\nupon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere else foiled\\r\\nin his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby Dick, in the\\r\\nsea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he might most\\r\\nreasonably be presumed to be haunting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his crew\\r\\ndrink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time, now,\\r\\nthe circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs no\\r\\nsustenance but what\\u2019s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the\\r\\nwhaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be\\r\\ntransferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries\\r\\nno cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a\\r\\nwhole lake\\u2019s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted\\r\\nwith utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She\\r\\ncarries years\\u2019 water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,\\r\\nwhen three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to\\r\\ndrink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from\\r\\nthe Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may\\r\\nhave gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score\\r\\nof ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted\\r\\none grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like\\r\\nthemselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had\\r\\ncome; they would only answer\\u2014\\u201cWell, boys, here\\u2019s the ark!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of\\r\\nJava, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of\\r\\nthe ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an\\r\\nexcellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more\\r\\nand more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and\\r\\nadmonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the\\r\\nland soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils\\r\\nthe fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was\\r\\ndescried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game\\r\\nhereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the\\r\\ncustomary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle of\\r\\nsingular magnificence saluted us.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with which\\r\\nof late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm Whales,\\r\\ninstead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies, as in\\r\\nformer times, are now frequently met with in extensive herds, sometimes\\r\\nembracing so great a multitude, that it would almost seem as if\\r\\nnumerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual\\r\\nassistance and protection. To this aggregation of the Sperm Whale into\\r\\nsuch immense caravans, may be imputed the circumstance that even in the\\r\\nbest cruising grounds, you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months\\r\\ntogether, without being greeted by a single spout; and then be suddenly\\r\\nsaluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands.\\r\\n\\r\\nBroad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and\\r\\nforming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon,\\r\\na continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the\\r\\nnoon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right\\r\\nWhale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the cleft\\r\\ndrooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of the\\r\\nSperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually\\r\\nrising and falling away to leeward.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeen from the Pequod\\u2019s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of\\r\\nthe sea, this host of vapoury spouts, individually curling up into the\\r\\nair, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed\\r\\nlike the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried\\r\\nof a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,\\r\\naccelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in\\r\\ntheir rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain;\\r\\neven so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through\\r\\nthe straits; gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle, and\\r\\nswimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers\\r\\nhandling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their\\r\\nyet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that\\r\\nchased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy\\r\\ninto the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their\\r\\nnumber. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby\\r\\nDick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped\\r\\nwhite-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\\r\\nstun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans\\r\\nbefore us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly\\r\\ndirecting attention to something in our wake.\\r\\n\\r\\nCorresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear.\\r\\nIt seemed formed of detached white vapours, rising and falling something\\r\\nlike the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and\\r\\ngo; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling\\r\\nhis glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole,\\r\\ncrying, \\u201cAloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the\\r\\nsails;\\u2014Malays, sir, and after us!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should\\r\\nfairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in hot\\r\\npursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift\\r\\nPequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how very\\r\\nkind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her\\r\\nown chosen pursuit,\\u2014mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they\\r\\nwere. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in his\\r\\nforward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the\\r\\nbloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed\\r\\nhis. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in\\r\\nwhich the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that\\r\\ngate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that\\r\\nsame gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end;\\r\\nand not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and\\r\\ninhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their\\r\\ncurses;\\u2014when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab\\u2019s\\r\\nbrow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some\\r\\nstormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm\\r\\nthing from its place.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\\r\\nwhen, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the\\r\\nPequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra\\r\\nside, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\\r\\nharpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining\\r\\nupon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained\\r\\nupon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the whales, at\\r\\nlength they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them;\\r\\nand the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But\\r\\nno sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm\\r\\nWhale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,\\u2014though\\r\\nas yet a mile in their rear,\\u2014than they rallied again, and forming\\r\\nin close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like\\r\\nflashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\\r\\n\\r\\nStripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\\r\\nafter several hours\\u2019 pulling were almost disposed to renounce the\\r\\nchase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating\\r\\ntoken that they were now at last under the influence of that strange\\r\\nperplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive\\r\\nit in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns\\r\\nin which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now\\r\\nbroken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus\\u2019 elephants\\r\\nin the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with\\r\\nconsternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,\\r\\nand aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick\\r\\nspoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was\\r\\nstill more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely\\r\\nparalysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled\\r\\nships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep,\\r\\npursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly\\r\\nhave evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is\\r\\ncharacteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though banding together\\r\\nin tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled\\r\\nbefore a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when\\r\\nherded together in the sheepfold of a theatre\\u2019s pit, they will, at the\\r\\nslightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\\r\\ntrampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,\\r\\ntherefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales\\r\\nbefore us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not\\r\\ninfinitely outdone by the madness of men.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\\r\\nyet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\\r\\nretreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\\r\\nthose cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone\\r\\nwhale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes\\u2019 time,\\r\\nQueequeg\\u2019s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\\r\\nin our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight\\r\\nfor the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the\\r\\nwhale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and\\r\\nindeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present\\r\\none of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift\\r\\nmonster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid\\r\\nadieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\\r\\nspeed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\\r\\nthus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\\r\\nthe crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\\r\\nlike a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\\r\\nthrough their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\\r\\nmoment it may be locked in and crushed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\\r\\nfrom this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away\\r\\nfrom that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the\\r\\ntime, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our\\r\\nway whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time\\r\\nto make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted\\r\\nduty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the\\r\\nshouting part of the business. \\u201cOut of the way, Commodore!\\u201d cried\\r\\none, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\\r\\nand for an instant threatened to swamp us. \\u201cHard down with your tail,\\r\\nthere!\\u201d cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\\r\\ncalmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\\r\\nby the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood\\r\\nof equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\\r\\nother\\u2019s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\\r\\nattached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\\r\\nbeing looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly\\r\\namong gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales\\r\\nare close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm\\r\\nwhales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must\\r\\nkill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing\\r\\nthem, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it\\r\\nis, that at times like these the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat\\r\\nwas furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully\\r\\ndarted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the\\r\\nenormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like\\r\\nmalefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the\\r\\nact of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one\\r\\nof the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it\\r\\naway, dropping the oarsman in the boat\\u2019s bottom as the seat slid from\\r\\nunder him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we\\r\\nstuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for\\r\\nthe time.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\\r\\nit not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale\\u2019s way greatly\\r\\ndiminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from the\\r\\ncircumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that\\r\\nwhen at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways\\r\\nvanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we\\r\\nglided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if\\r\\nfrom some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here\\r\\nthe storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard\\r\\nbut not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth\\r\\nsatin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture\\r\\nthrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now\\r\\nin that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every\\r\\ncommotion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of\\r\\nthe outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight\\r\\nor ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of\\r\\nhorses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic\\r\\ncircus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have\\r\\ngone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing\\r\\nwhales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\\r\\npossible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for\\r\\na breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only\\r\\nadmitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake,\\r\\nwe were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women\\r\\nand children of this routed host.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\\r\\nouter circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\\r\\nany one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\\r\\nthe whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\\r\\nmiles. At any rate\\u2014though indeed such a test at such a time might be\\r\\ndeceptive\\u2014spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that\\r\\nseemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this\\r\\ncircumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely\\r\\nlocked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the\\r\\nherd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its\\r\\nstopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way\\r\\ninnocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller\\r\\nwhales\\u2014now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the\\r\\nlake\\u2014evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still\\r\\nbecharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like household\\r\\ndogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales, and\\r\\ntouching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly\\r\\ndomesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched\\r\\ntheir backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the\\r\\ntime refrained from darting it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still\\r\\nstranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended\\r\\nin those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the\\r\\nwhales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to\\r\\nbecome mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth\\r\\nexceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will calmly\\r\\nand fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two different\\r\\nlives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment, be still\\r\\nspiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;\\u2014even so did the\\r\\nyoung of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at us, as if\\r\\nwe were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight. Floating on their\\r\\nsides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One of these little\\r\\ninfants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old, might\\r\\nhave measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six feet in\\r\\ngirth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed scarce yet\\r\\nrecovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the\\r\\nmaternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready for the final\\r\\nspring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar\\u2019s bow. The delicate\\r\\nside-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly retained the\\r\\nplaited crumpled appearance of a baby\\u2019s ears newly arrived from\\r\\nforeign parts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLine! line!\\u201d cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; \\u201chim\\r\\nfast! him fast!\\u2014Who line him! Who struck?\\u2014Two whale; one big, one\\r\\nlittle!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat ails ye, man?\\u201d cried Starbuck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook-e here,\\u201d said Queequeg, pointing down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of\\r\\nfathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and shows\\r\\nthe slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the\\r\\nair; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of Madame\\r\\nLeviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam. Not\\r\\nseldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this natural line, with\\r\\nthe maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the hempen one, so that\\r\\nthe cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest secrets of the seas\\r\\nseemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We saw young Leviathan\\r\\namours in the deep.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but unlike\\r\\nmost other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a gestation\\r\\nwhich may probably be set down at nine months, producing but one at a\\r\\ntime; though in some few known instances giving birth to an Esau and\\r\\nJacob:\\u2014a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats, curiously\\r\\nsituated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts themselves\\r\\nextend upwards from that. When by chance these precious parts in a\\r\\nnursing whale are cut by the hunter\\u2019s lance, the mother\\u2019s pouring\\r\\nmilk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk is\\r\\nvery sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well with\\r\\nstrawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales salute\\r\\nmore hominum.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations\\r\\nand affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and\\r\\nfearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled\\r\\nin dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of\\r\\nmy being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm; and\\r\\nwhile ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down and\\r\\ndeep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic\\r\\nspectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,\\r\\nstill engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or\\r\\npossibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance of\\r\\nroom and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight\\r\\nof the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro\\r\\nacross the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is\\r\\nsometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful\\r\\nand alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or\\r\\nmaiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled\\r\\ncutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again.\\r\\nA whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not\\r\\neffectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying along\\r\\nwith him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony of\\r\\nthe wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone\\r\\nmounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying dismay\\r\\nwherever he went.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling spectacle\\r\\nenough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to\\r\\ninspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first the\\r\\nintervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived that\\r\\nby one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale had\\r\\nbecome entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run\\r\\naway with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope\\r\\nattached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the\\r\\nharpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose\\r\\nfrom his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning\\r\\nthrough the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and\\r\\ntossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own\\r\\ncomrades.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their\\r\\nstationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake\\r\\nbegan to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted\\r\\nby half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to\\r\\nheave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;\\r\\nin more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\\r\\ncircles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\\r\\ndeparting. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the\\r\\ntumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in\\r\\nSpring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre,\\r\\nas if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly Starbuck\\r\\nand Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOars! Oars!\\u201d he intensely whispered, seizing the helm\\u2014\\u201cgripe\\r\\nyour oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove\\r\\nhim off, you Queequeg\\u2014the whale there!\\u2014prick him!\\u2014hit him! Stand\\r\\nup\\u2014stand up, and stay so! Spring, men\\u2014pull, men; never mind their\\r\\nbacks\\u2014scrape them!\\u2014scrape away!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a\\r\\nnarrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate endeavor\\r\\nwe at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way rapidly,\\r\\nand at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet. After many\\r\\nsimilar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into what had\\r\\njust been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random whales,\\r\\nall violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was cheaply\\r\\npurchased by the loss of Queequeg\\u2019s hat, who, while standing in the\\r\\nbows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his head\\r\\nby the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes\\r\\nclose by.\\r\\n\\r\\nRiotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon\\r\\nresolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having\\r\\nclumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their\\r\\nonward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but\\r\\nthe boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales\\r\\nmight be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had\\r\\nkilled and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of which\\r\\nare carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at hand,\\r\\nare inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both to\\r\\nmark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession, should\\r\\nthe boats of any other ship draw near.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious\\r\\nsaying in the Fishery,\\u2014the more whales the less fish. Of all the\\r\\ndrugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for\\r\\nthe time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some other\\r\\ncraft than the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm\\r\\nWhales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those\\r\\nvast aggregations.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must\\r\\nhave been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are\\r\\noccasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.\\r\\nSuch bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those\\r\\ncomposed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young\\r\\nvigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a\\r\\nmale of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces\\r\\nhis gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his\\r\\nladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about\\r\\nover the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces\\r\\nand endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and\\r\\nhis concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest\\r\\nleviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not\\r\\nmore than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are\\r\\ncomparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen\\r\\nyards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the\\r\\nwhole they are hereditarily entitled to embonpoint.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent\\r\\nramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in leisurely\\r\\nsearch of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the full flower\\r\\nof the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned, perhaps, from\\r\\nspending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating summer of all\\r\\nunpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have lounged up and\\r\\ndown the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for the Oriental\\r\\nwaters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so evade the other\\r\\nexcessive temperature of the year.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange\\r\\nsuspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his\\r\\ninteresting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan coming\\r\\nthat way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies,\\r\\nwith what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases him away!\\r\\nHigh times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be\\r\\npermitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do what the\\r\\nBashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of his bed;\\r\\nfor, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often cause the\\r\\nmost terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with the whales,\\r\\nwho sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They fence with\\r\\ntheir long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and so striving\\r\\nfor the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers. Not\\r\\na few are captured having the deep scars of these encounters,\\u2014furrowed\\r\\nheads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some instances, wrenched and\\r\\ndislocated mouths.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at\\r\\nthe first rush of the harem\\u2019s lord, then is it very diverting to\\r\\nwatch that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and\\r\\nrevels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,\\r\\nlike pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.\\r\\nGranting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give\\r\\nchase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish\\r\\nof their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the\\r\\nsons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must\\r\\ntake care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For\\r\\nlike certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my Lord\\r\\nWhale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower; and so,\\r\\nbeing a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all over the\\r\\nworld; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as the ardour\\r\\nof youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as reflection lends\\r\\nher solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude overtakes the sated\\r\\nTurk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens; our\\r\\nOttoman enters upon the impotent, repentant, admonitory stage of life,\\r\\nforswears, disbands the harem, and grown to an exemplary, sulky old\\r\\nsoul, goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his\\r\\nprayers, and warning each young Leviathan from his amorous errors.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so\\r\\nis the lord and master of that school technically known as the\\r\\nschoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however admirably\\r\\nsatirical, that after going to school himself, he should then go abroad\\r\\ninculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it. His title,\\r\\nschoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed\\r\\nupon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the man who first\\r\\nthus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read the memoirs of\\r\\nVidocq, and informed himself what sort of a country-schoolmaster that\\r\\nfamous Frenchman was in his younger days, and what was the nature of\\r\\nthose occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale\\r\\nbetakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm\\r\\nWhales. Almost universally, a lone whale\\u2014as a solitary Leviathan\\r\\nis called\\u2014proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel\\r\\nBoone, he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he\\r\\ntakes to wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is,\\r\\nthough she keeps so many moody secrets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously\\r\\nmentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while\\r\\nthose female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or\\r\\nforty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious\\r\\nof all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;\\r\\nexcepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,\\r\\nand these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like\\r\\na mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,\\r\\ntumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no\\r\\nprudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous\\r\\nlad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,\\r\\nand when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in\\r\\nquest of settlements, that is, harems.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother point of difference between the male and female schools is\\r\\nstill more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a\\r\\nForty-barrel-bull\\u2014poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike\\r\\na member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with\\r\\nevery token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as\\r\\nthemselves to fall a prey.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,\\r\\nnecessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale\\r\\nfishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,\\r\\na whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed\\r\\nand captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised\\r\\nmany minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For\\r\\nexample,\\u2014after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale,\\r\\nthe body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and\\r\\ndrifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a\\r\\ncalm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus\\r\\nthe most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between\\r\\nthe fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,\\r\\nundisputed law applicable to all cases.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative\\r\\nenactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in\\r\\nA.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling\\r\\nlaw, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and\\r\\nlawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse\\r\\ncomprehensiveness surpasses Justinian\\u2019s Pandects and the By-laws\\r\\nof the Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other\\r\\nPeople\\u2019s Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen\\r\\nAnne\\u2019s farthing, or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so\\r\\nsmall are they.\\r\\n\\r\\nI. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nII. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable\\r\\nbrevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to\\r\\nexpound it.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,\\r\\nwhen it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at all\\r\\ncontrollable by the occupant or occupants,\\u2014a mast, an oar, a nine-inch\\r\\ncable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the same.\\r\\nLikewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any other\\r\\nrecognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it plainly\\r\\nevince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well as their\\r\\nintention so to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen\\r\\nthemselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks\\u2014the\\r\\nCoke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and\\r\\nhonourable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases,\\r\\nwhere it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim\\r\\npossession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But\\r\\nothers are by no means so scrupulous.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated\\r\\nin England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of\\r\\na whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had\\r\\nsucceeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of\\r\\ntheir lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat\\r\\nitself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up\\r\\nwith the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it\\r\\nbefore the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants\\r\\nwere remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the\\r\\nplaintiffs\\u2019 teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the\\r\\ndeed he had done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat,\\r\\nwhich had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure.\\r\\nWherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their\\r\\nwhale, line, harpoons, and boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nMr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was\\r\\nthe judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on\\r\\nto illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,\\r\\nwherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife\\u2019s\\r\\nviciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in\\r\\nthe course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to\\r\\nrecover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he\\r\\nthen supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally\\r\\nharpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the\\r\\ngreat stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet\\r\\nabandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore\\r\\nwhen a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that\\r\\nsubsequent gentleman\\u2019s property, along with whatever harpoon might\\r\\nhave been found sticking in her.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the whale\\r\\nand the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very\\r\\nlearned Judge in set terms decided, to wit,\\u2014That as for the boat, he\\r\\nawarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it\\r\\nto save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,\\r\\nharpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because\\r\\nit was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons\\r\\nand line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\\r\\nacquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\\r\\ntook the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took\\r\\nthe fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.\\r\\n\\r\\nA common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might\\r\\npossibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the\\r\\nmatter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws\\r\\npreviously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in\\r\\nthe above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,\\r\\nI say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human\\r\\njurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture,\\r\\nthe Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines, has but two\\r\\nprops to stand on.\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it not a saying in every one\\u2019s mouth, Possession is half of the\\r\\nlaw: that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But\\r\\noften possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls\\r\\nof Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession\\r\\nis the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow\\u2019s\\r\\nlast mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain\\u2019s marble\\r\\nmansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?\\r\\nWhat is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor\\r\\nWoebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone\\u2019s family from\\r\\nstarvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the\\r\\nArchbishop of Savesoul\\u2019s income of L100,000 seized from the scant\\r\\nbread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all\\r\\nsure of heaven without any of Savesoul\\u2019s help) what is that globular\\r\\nL100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder\\u2019s hereditary\\r\\ntowns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer, John\\r\\nBull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic lancer,\\r\\nBrother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all these, is\\r\\nnot Possession the whole of the law?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable,\\r\\nthe kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is\\r\\ninternationally and universally applicable.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the\\r\\nSpanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress?\\r\\nWhat was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India\\r\\nto England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All\\r\\nLoose-Fish.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but\\r\\nLoose-Fish? What all men\\u2019s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is\\r\\nthe principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to\\r\\nthe ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but\\r\\nLoose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what\\r\\nare you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDe balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.\\u201d\\r\\nBracton, l. 3, c. 3.\\r\\n\\r\\nLatin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the\\r\\ncontext, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of\\r\\nthat land, the King, as Honourary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,\\r\\nand the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division which,\\r\\nin the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no intermediate\\r\\nremainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to this day in\\r\\nforce in England; and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly\\r\\ntouching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is here treated of\\r\\nin a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle that prompts\\r\\nthe English railways to be at the expense of a separate car, specially\\r\\nreserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first place, in\\r\\ncurious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is still in\\r\\nforce, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within\\r\\nthe last two years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one\\r\\nof the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and\\r\\nbeaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from\\r\\nthe shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the\\r\\njurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.\\r\\nHolding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal\\r\\nemoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment\\r\\nhis. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.\\r\\nBecause the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his\\r\\nperquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their\\r\\ntrowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their fat\\r\\nfish high and dry, promising themselves a good L150 from the precious\\r\\noil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives, and good\\r\\nale with their cronies, upon the strength of their respective shares; up\\r\\nsteps a very learned and most Christian and charitable gentleman, with a\\r\\ncopy of Blackstone under his arm; and laying it upon the whale\\u2019s head,\\r\\nhe says\\u2014\\u201cHands off! this fish, my masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize\\r\\nit as the Lord Warden\\u2019s.\\u201d Upon this the poor mariners in their\\r\\nrespectful consternation\\u2014so truly English\\u2014knowing not what to say,\\r\\nfall to vigorously scratching their heads all round; meanwhile ruefully\\r\\nglancing from the whale to the stranger. But that did in nowise mend the\\r\\nmatter, or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with\\r\\nthe copy of Blackstone. At length one of them, after long scratching\\r\\nabout for his ideas, made bold to speak,\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPlease, sir, who is the Lord Warden?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe Duke.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is his.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is\\r\\nall that to go to the Duke\\u2019s benefit; we getting nothing at all for\\r\\nour pains but our blisters?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is his.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIs the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of\\r\\ngetting a livelihood?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is his.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of\\r\\nthis whale.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is his.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWon\\u2019t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt is his.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of\\r\\nWellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular\\r\\nlights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be\\r\\ndeemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman\\r\\nof the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to\\r\\ntake the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To\\r\\nwhich my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)\\r\\nthat he had already done so, and received the money, and would be\\r\\nobliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend\\r\\ngentleman) would decline meddling with other people\\u2019s business. Is\\r\\nthis the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three\\r\\nkingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the\\r\\nDuke to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs\\r\\ninquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested with\\r\\nthat right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon gives\\r\\nus the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs to the\\r\\nKing and Queen, \\u201cbecause of its superior excellence.\\u201d And by the\\r\\nsoundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such\\r\\nmatters.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason\\r\\nfor that, ye lawyers!\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his treatise on \\u201cQueen-Gold,\\u201d or Queen-pinmoney, an old King\\u2019s\\r\\nBench author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: \\u201cYe tail is\\r\\nye Queen\\u2019s, that ye Queen\\u2019s wardrobe may be supplied with ye\\r\\nwhalebone.\\u201d Now this was written at a time when the black limber bone\\r\\nof the Greenland or Right whale was largely used in ladies\\u2019 bodices.\\r\\nBut this same bone is not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad\\r\\nmistake for a sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid,\\r\\nto be presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers\\u2014the\\r\\nwhale and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations,\\r\\nand nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown\\u2019s ordinary\\r\\nrevenue. I know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but\\r\\nby inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the\\r\\nsame way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic\\r\\nhead peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly\\r\\nbe humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there\\r\\nseems a reason in all things, even in law.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIn vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this\\r\\nLeviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.\\u201d Sir T. Browne,\\r\\nV.E.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when we\\r\\nwere slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapoury, mid-day sea, that the many\\r\\nnoses on the Pequod\\u2019s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the\\r\\nthree pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell was\\r\\nsmelt in the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will bet something now,\\u201d said Stubb, \\u201cthat somewhere hereabouts\\r\\nare some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought\\r\\nthey would keel up before long.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently, the vapours in advance slid aside; and there in the distance\\r\\nlay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be\\r\\nalongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours from\\r\\nhis peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that circled, and\\r\\nhovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the whale alongside\\r\\nmust be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that is, a whale that\\r\\nhas died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an unappropriated corpse.\\r\\nIt may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor such a mass must\\r\\nexhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague, when the living are\\r\\nincompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable indeed is it regarded\\r\\nby some, that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it.\\r\\nYet are there those who will still do it; notwithstanding the fact that\\r\\nthe oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality, and\\r\\nby no means of the nature of attar-of-rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nComing still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman\\r\\nhad a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more\\r\\nof a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of\\r\\nthose problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort\\r\\nof prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies\\r\\nalmost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the\\r\\nproper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn\\r\\nup his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted\\r\\nwhales in general.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed\\r\\nhe recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were\\r\\nknotted round the tail of one of these whales.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a pretty fellow, now,\\u201d he banteringly laughed, standing\\r\\nin the ship\\u2019s bows, \\u201cthere\\u2019s a jackal for ye! I well know\\r\\nthat these Crappoes of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery;\\r\\nsometimes lowering their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm\\r\\nWhale spouts; yes, and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold\\r\\nfull of boxes of tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that\\r\\nall the oil they will get won\\u2019t be enough to dip the Captain\\u2019s wick\\r\\ninto; aye, we all know these things; but look ye, here\\u2019s a Crappo that\\r\\nis content with our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and\\r\\nis content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish\\r\\nhe has there. Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let\\u2019s\\r\\nmake him a present of a little oil for dear charity\\u2019s sake. For what\\r\\noil he\\u2019ll get from that drugged whale there, wouldn\\u2019t be fit to burn\\r\\nin a jail; no, not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why,\\r\\nI\\u2019ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three\\r\\nmasts of ours, than he\\u2019ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now\\r\\nthat I think of it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than\\r\\noil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that.\\r\\nIt\\u2019s worth trying. Yes, I\\u2019m for it;\\u201d and so saying he started for\\r\\nthe quarter-deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether\\r\\nor no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of\\r\\nescaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb\\r\\nnow called his boat\\u2019s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing\\r\\nacross her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French\\r\\ntaste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a\\r\\nhuge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper\\r\\nspikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a\\r\\nsymmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon her head boards,\\r\\nin large gilt letters, he read \\u201cBouton de Rose,\\u201d\\u2014Rose-button, or\\r\\nRose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nThough Stubb did not understand the Bouton part of the inscription, yet\\r\\nthe word rose, and the bulbous figure-head put together, sufficiently\\r\\nexplained the whole to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA wooden rose-bud, eh?\\u201d he cried with his hand to his nose, \\u201cthat\\r\\nwill do very well; but how like all creation it smells!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he\\r\\nhad to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close to\\r\\nthe blasted whale; and so talk over it.\\r\\n\\r\\nArrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he\\r\\nbawled\\u2014\\u201cBouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses\\r\\nthat speak English?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes,\\u201d rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to\\r\\nbe the chief-mate.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat whale?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe White Whale\\u2014a Sperm Whale\\u2014Moby Dick, have ye seen him?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNever heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale\\u2014no.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cVery good, then; good bye now, and I\\u2019ll call again in a minute.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\\r\\nover the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands\\r\\ninto a trumpet and shouted\\u2014\\u201cNo, Sir! No!\\u201d Upon which Ahab retired,\\r\\nand Stubb returned to the Frenchman.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the\\r\\nchains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of\\r\\nbag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter with your nose, there?\\u201d said Stubb. \\u201cBroke\\r\\nit?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI wish it was broken, or that I didn\\u2019t have any nose at all!\\u201d\\r\\nanswered the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at\\r\\nvery much. \\u201cBut what are you holding yours for?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, nothing! It\\u2019s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day,\\r\\nain\\u2019t it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of\\r\\nposies, will ye, Bouton-de-Rose?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat in the devil\\u2019s name do you want here?\\u201d roared the\\r\\nGuernseyman, flying into a sudden passion.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! keep cool\\u2014cool? yes, that\\u2019s the word! why don\\u2019t you pack\\r\\nthose whales in ice while you\\u2019re working at \\u2018em? But joking aside,\\r\\nthough; do you know, Rose-bud, that it\\u2019s all nonsense trying to get\\r\\nany oil out of such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn\\u2019t\\r\\na gill in his whole carcase.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI know that well enough; but, d\\u2019ye see, the Captain here won\\u2019t\\r\\nbelieve it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer\\r\\nbefore. But come aboard, and mayhap he\\u2019ll believe you, if he won\\u2019t\\r\\nme; and so I\\u2019ll get out of this dirty scrape.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\\u201d rejoined\\r\\nStubb, and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene\\r\\npresented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were\\r\\ngetting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked\\r\\nrather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good\\r\\nhumor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many\\r\\njib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up\\r\\nto the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch\\r\\nthe plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\\r\\nnostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\\r\\noff at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\\r\\nconstantly filled their olfactories.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\\r\\nthe Captain\\u2019s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\\r\\nfiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within.\\r\\nThis was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating against\\r\\nthe proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain\\u2019s\\r\\nround-house (cabinet he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could\\r\\nnot help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.\\r\\n\\r\\nMarking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\\r\\nGuernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\\r\\nexpressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus,\\r\\nwho had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\\r\\nSounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\\r\\nhad not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\\r\\nheld his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\\r\\nconfidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\\r\\nfor both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\\r\\ndreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\\r\\nof theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter\\u2019s office,\\r\\nwas to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and\\r\\nas for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in\\r\\nhim during the interview.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\\r\\nsmall and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\\r\\nlarge whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest\\r\\nwith watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely\\r\\nintroduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the\\r\\naspect of interpreting between them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat shall I say to him first?\\u201d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy,\\u201d said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals,\\r\\n\\u201cyou may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish\\r\\nto me, though I don\\u2019t pretend to be a judge.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe says, Monsieur,\\u201d said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning\\r\\nto his captain, \\u201cthat only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose\\r\\ncaptain and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught\\r\\nfrom a blasted whale they had brought alongside.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat now?\\u201d said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\\r\\ncarefully, I\\u2019m quite certain that he\\u2019s no more fit to command a\\r\\nwhale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he\\u2019s a\\r\\nbaboon.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,\\r\\nis far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures\\r\\nus, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\\r\\ncrew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose\\r\\nthe cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat now?\\u201d said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that\\u2014that\\u2014in\\r\\nfact, tell him I\\u2019ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps\\r\\nsomebody else.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe says, Monsieur, that he\\u2019s very happy to have been of any service\\r\\nto us.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\\r\\n(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his\\r\\ncabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\\u201d said the\\r\\ninterpreter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThank him heartily; but tell him it\\u2019s against my principles to\\r\\ndrink with the man I\\u2019ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe says, Monsieur, that his principles won\\u2019t admit of his drinking;\\r\\nbut that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur\\r\\nhad best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,\\r\\nfor it\\u2019s so calm they won\\u2019t drift.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBy this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\\r\\nthe Guernsey-man to this effect,\\u2014that having a long tow-line in his\\r\\nboat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter\\r\\nwhale of the two from the ship\\u2019s side. While the Frenchman\\u2019s boats,\\r\\nthen, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed\\r\\naway at his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most\\r\\nunusually long tow-line.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\\r\\nhoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the\\r\\nPequod slid in between him and Stubb\\u2019s whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly\\r\\npulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of\\r\\nhis intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous\\r\\ncunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the\\r\\nbody, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was\\r\\ndigging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck\\r\\nagainst the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and\\r\\npottery buried in fat English loam. His boat\\u2019s crew were all in high\\r\\nexcitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as\\r\\ngold-hunters.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\\r\\nscreaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\\r\\nto look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when\\r\\nsuddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint\\r\\nstream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without\\r\\nbeing absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with\\r\\nanother, without at all blending with it for a time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have it, I have it,\\u201d cried Stubb, with delight, striking\\r\\nsomething in the subterranean regions, \\u201ca purse! a purse!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls\\r\\nof something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\\r\\ncheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with\\r\\nyour thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good\\r\\nfriends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist.\\r\\nSome six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the\\r\\nsea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for\\r\\nimpatient Ahab\\u2019s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come on board,\\r\\nelse the ship would bid them good bye.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 92. Ambergris.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\\r\\nan article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\\r\\nCoffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\\r\\nsubject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\\r\\nthe precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\\r\\nto the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for\\r\\ngrey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though\\r\\nat times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland\\r\\nsoils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides,\\r\\namber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for\\r\\nmouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,\\r\\nwaxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in\\r\\nperfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.\\r\\nThe Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same\\r\\npurpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter\\u2019s in Rome. Some wine\\r\\nmerchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWho would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale\\r\\nthemselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick\\r\\nwhale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and\\r\\nby others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such\\r\\na dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four\\r\\nboat loads of Brandreth\\u2019s pills, and then running out of harm\\u2019s way,\\r\\nas laborers do in blasting rocks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,\\r\\ncertain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be\\r\\nsailors\\u2019 trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were\\r\\nnothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\\r\\nfound in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\\r\\nsaying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\\r\\nhow that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory. And likewise\\r\\ncall to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh\\r\\nthe best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\\r\\nill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the\\r\\nworst.\\r\\n\\r\\nI should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,\\r\\nowing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen,\\r\\nand which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be\\r\\nconsidered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the\\r\\nFrenchman\\u2019s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\\r\\naspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout\\r\\na slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to rebut. They\\r\\nhint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma\\r\\noriginate?\\r\\n\\r\\nI opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\\r\\nGreenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\\r\\nthose whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as\\r\\nthe Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in\\r\\nsmall bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry\\r\\nit home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas,\\r\\nand the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding\\r\\nany other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold,\\r\\nand unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a\\r\\nsavor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an\\r\\nold city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\nI partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\\r\\nlikewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\\r\\ntimes, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\\r\\nlatter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\\r\\nwork on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,\\r\\nfat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a\\r\\nplace for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without\\r\\nbeing taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of\\r\\nfurnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full\\r\\noperation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is\\r\\nquite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four\\r\\nyears perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not,\\r\\nperhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the\\r\\nstate that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that\\r\\nliving or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by\\r\\nno means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the\\r\\npeople of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by\\r\\nthe nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\\r\\nwhen, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance\\r\\nof exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the\\r\\nopen air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale\\u2019s flukes above water\\r\\ndispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a\\r\\nwarm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance,\\r\\nconsidering his magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with\\r\\njewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian\\r\\ntown to do honour to Alexander the Great?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 93. The Castaway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most\\r\\nsignificant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod\\u2019s crew;\\r\\nan event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes\\r\\nmadly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying\\r\\nprophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some\\r\\nfew hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work\\r\\nthe vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing,\\r\\nthese ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the\\r\\nboats\\u2019 crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,\\r\\nor timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a\\r\\nship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by\\r\\nnick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him\\r\\nbefore; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so\\r\\ngloomy-jolly.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a\\r\\nwhite one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in\\r\\none eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and\\r\\ntorpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom\\r\\nvery bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to\\r\\nhis tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities\\r\\nwith finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks, the year\\u2019s\\r\\ncalendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five Fourth\\r\\nof Julys and New Year\\u2019s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that this\\r\\nlittle black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;\\r\\nbehold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king\\u2019s cabinets. But Pip loved\\r\\nlife, and all life\\u2019s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking\\r\\nbusiness in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had\\r\\nmost sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,\\r\\nwhat was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be\\r\\nluridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him\\r\\noff to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland\\r\\nCounty in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler\\u2019s frolic\\r\\non the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned\\r\\nthe round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the\\r\\nclear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the pure-watered\\r\\ndiamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning jeweller would\\r\\nshow you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he lays it against\\r\\na gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun, but by some\\r\\nunnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences, infernally\\r\\nsuperb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest symbol of the\\r\\ncrystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from the King of Hell.\\r\\nBut let us to the story.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb\\u2019s after-oarsman\\r\\nchanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;\\r\\nand, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;\\r\\nbut happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and\\r\\ntherefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing\\r\\nhim, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness\\r\\nto the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\\r\\nthe fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\\r\\nhappened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip\\u2019s seat. The\\r\\ninvoluntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\\r\\nhand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\\r\\nline coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\\r\\nto become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\\r\\ninstant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\\r\\nstraightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks\\r\\nof the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\\r\\nseveral turns around his chest and neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nTashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\\r\\nhated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\\r\\nhe suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\\r\\nexclaimed interrogatively, \\u201cCut?\\u201d Meantime Pip\\u2019s blue, choked face\\r\\nplainly looked, Do, for God\\u2019s sake! All passed in a flash. In less\\r\\nthan half a minute, this entire thing happened.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDamn him, cut!\\u201d roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\\r\\nsaved.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\\r\\nby yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\\r\\nirregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\\r\\nbut still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\\r\\nunofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\\r\\njump from a boat, Pip, except\\u2014but all the rest was indefinite, as the\\r\\nsoundest advice ever is. Now, in general, Stick to the boat, is your\\r\\ntrue motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when Leap from\\r\\nthe boat, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he\\r\\nshould give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving\\r\\nhim too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped\\r\\nall advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, \\u201cStick to the\\r\\nboat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won\\u2019t pick you up if you jump; mind that.\\r\\nWe can\\u2019t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell\\r\\nfor thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and\\r\\ndon\\u2019t jump any more.\\u201d Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\\r\\nthough man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\\r\\npropensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\\r\\nunder very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time\\r\\nhe did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to\\r\\nrun, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller\\u2019s trunk.\\r\\nAlas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous,\\r\\nblue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away,\\r\\nall round, to the horizon, like gold-beater\\u2019s skin hammered out to\\r\\nthe extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip\\u2019s ebon head showed\\r\\nlike a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly\\r\\nastern. Stubb\\u2019s inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was\\r\\nwinged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between\\r\\nPip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his\\r\\ncrisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though\\r\\nthe loftiest and the brightest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\\r\\npractised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\\r\\nlonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\\r\\nmiddle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,\\r\\nhow when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea\\u2014mark how closely\\r\\nthey hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he\\r\\ndid not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\\r\\nand he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very\\r\\nquickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards\\r\\noarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested\\r\\nby the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not\\r\\nunfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\\r\\ncalled, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\\r\\nmilitary navies and armies.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\\r\\nspying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\\r\\nStubb\\u2019s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\\r\\nupon his fish, that Pip\\u2019s ringed horizon began to expand around him\\r\\nmiserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but\\r\\nfrom that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at\\r\\nleast, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\\r\\nup, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.\\r\\nRather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\\r\\nthe unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;\\r\\nand the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the\\r\\njoyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\\r\\nGod-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters\\r\\nheaved the colossal orbs. He saw God\\u2019s foot upon the treadle of the\\r\\nloom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So\\r\\nman\\u2019s insanity is heaven\\u2019s sense; and wandering from all mortal\\r\\nreason, man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason,\\r\\nis absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,\\r\\nindifferent as his God.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that\\r\\nfishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what\\r\\nlike abandonment befell myself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat whale of Stubb\\u2019s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to\\r\\nthe Pequod\\u2019s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations\\r\\npreviously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of\\r\\nthe Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed\\r\\nin dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and\\r\\nwhen the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated\\r\\nere going to the try-works, of which anon.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with several\\r\\nothers, I sat down before a large Constantine\\u2019s bath of it, I found\\r\\nit strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about in the\\r\\nliquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid.\\r\\nA sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this sperm was\\r\\nsuch a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener! such a\\r\\nsoftener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it for\\r\\nonly a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it were, to\\r\\nserpentine and spiralise.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter\\r\\nexertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under\\r\\nindolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands among\\r\\nthose soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost within\\r\\nthe hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all their\\r\\nopulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that\\r\\nuncontaminated aroma,\\u2014literally and truly, like the smell of spring\\r\\nviolets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky\\r\\nmeadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible\\r\\nsperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit\\r\\nthe old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying\\r\\nthe heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely free from\\r\\nall ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nSqueeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm\\r\\ntill I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a\\r\\nstrange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly\\r\\nsqueezing my co-laborers\\u2019 hands in it, mistaking their hands for\\r\\nthe gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving\\r\\nfeeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually\\r\\nsqueezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally;\\r\\nas much as to say,\\u2014Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer\\r\\ncherish any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy!\\r\\nCome; let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves\\r\\ninto each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk\\r\\nand sperm of kindness.\\r\\n\\r\\nWould that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since by\\r\\nmany prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all cases\\r\\nman must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of attainable\\r\\nfelicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy; but in\\r\\nthe wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the fireside, the\\r\\ncountry; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready to squeeze case\\r\\neternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of\\r\\nangels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things\\r\\nakin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the\\r\\ntry-works.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering\\r\\npart of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It\\r\\nis tough with congealed tendons\\u2014a wad of muscle\\u2014but still contains\\r\\nsome oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first\\r\\ncut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like\\r\\nblocks of Berkshire marble.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and\\r\\noften participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is\\r\\na most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name\\r\\nimports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked\\r\\nsnowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and\\r\\npurple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,\\r\\nit is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I stole\\r\\nbehind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should conceive\\r\\na royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have tasted,\\r\\nsupposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison\\r\\nseason, and that particular venison season contemporary with an\\r\\nunusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in\\r\\nthe course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling\\r\\nadequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation\\r\\noriginal with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.\\r\\nIt is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the\\r\\ntubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting.\\r\\nI hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,\\r\\ncoalescing.\\r\\n\\r\\nGurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but\\r\\nsometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the\\r\\ndark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland\\r\\nor right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior\\r\\nsouls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.\\r\\n\\r\\nNippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale\\u2019s\\r\\nvocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman\\u2019s\\r\\nnipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering\\r\\npart of Leviathan\\u2019s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for\\r\\nthe rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved\\r\\nalong the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and\\r\\nby nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all\\r\\nimpurities.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once\\r\\nto descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.\\r\\nThis place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the\\r\\nblanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper\\r\\ntime arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of\\r\\nterror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull\\r\\nlantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally\\r\\ngo in pairs,\\u2014a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is\\r\\nsimilar to a frigate\\u2019s boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is\\r\\nsomething like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a\\r\\nsheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship\\r\\npitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet\\r\\nitself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This\\r\\nspade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan\\u2019s feet are shoeless;\\r\\nthe thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from\\r\\nhim, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his\\r\\nassistants\\u2019, would you be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among\\r\\nveteran blubber-room men.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 95. The Cassock.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this\\r\\npost-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the\\r\\nwindlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small\\r\\ncuriosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen\\r\\nthere, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous\\r\\ncistern in the whale\\u2019s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged\\r\\nlower jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would\\r\\nso surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,\\u2014longer\\r\\nthan a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and\\r\\njet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it\\r\\nis; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as\\r\\nthat found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for\\r\\nworshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the\\r\\nidol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly set\\r\\nforth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and assisted\\r\\nby two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners call it,\\r\\nand with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier\\r\\ncarrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the forecastle\\r\\ndeck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt, as an\\r\\nAfrican hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt inside\\r\\nout, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as almost to\\r\\ndouble its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in the rigging,\\r\\nto dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some three feet of it,\\r\\ntowards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two slits for arm-holes\\r\\nat the other end, he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it. The mincer\\r\\nnow stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling.\\r\\nImmemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately\\r\\nprotect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the\\r\\npots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted\\r\\nendwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into\\r\\nwhich the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator\\u2019s\\r\\ndesk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent\\r\\non bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a\\r\\nPope were this mincer!*\\r\\n\\r\\n*Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates\\r\\nto the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as\\r\\nthin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of\\r\\nboiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably\\r\\nincreased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly distinguished\\r\\nby her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the most solid\\r\\nmasonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship.\\r\\nIt is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were transported to her\\r\\nplanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most\\r\\nroomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,\\r\\nfitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and\\r\\nmortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The\\r\\nfoundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly\\r\\nsecured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all\\r\\nsides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased\\r\\nwith wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened\\r\\nhatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in\\r\\nnumber, and each of several barrels\\u2019 capacity. When not in use, they\\r\\nare kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone\\r\\nand sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the\\r\\nnight-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil\\r\\nthemselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them\\u2014one\\r\\nman in each pot, side by side\\u2014many confidential communications\\r\\nare carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound\\r\\nmathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,\\r\\nwith the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first\\r\\nindirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies\\r\\ngliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from\\r\\nany point in precisely the same time.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemoving the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare\\r\\nmasonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of\\r\\nthe furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted\\r\\nwith heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented\\r\\nfrom communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir\\r\\nextending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel\\r\\ninserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as\\r\\nfast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct\\r\\nfrom the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was about nine o\\u2019clock at night that the Pequod\\u2019s try-works were\\r\\nfirst started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee\\r\\nthe business.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the\\r\\nworks.\\u201d This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting\\r\\nhis shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said\\r\\nthat in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed\\r\\nfor a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of\\r\\nquick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out, the\\r\\ncrisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still contains\\r\\nconsiderable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed the flames.\\r\\nLike a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming misanthrope, once\\r\\nignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body.\\r\\nWould that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is horrible to\\r\\ninhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you must live in\\r\\nit for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor about it, such\\r\\nas may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells like the left\\r\\nwing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the pit.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the\\r\\ncarcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean\\r\\ndarkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce\\r\\nflames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and\\r\\nilluminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek\\r\\nfire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to\\r\\nsome vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the\\r\\nbold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad\\r\\nsheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and\\r\\nfolded them in conflagrations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide hearth\\r\\nin front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of the\\r\\npagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship\\u2019s stokers. With huge pronged\\r\\npoles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots, or\\r\\nstirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted, curling, out\\r\\nof the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled away in sullen\\r\\nheaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil,\\r\\nwhich seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces. Opposite the mouth\\r\\nof the works, on the further side of the wide wooden hearth, was the\\r\\nwindlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the watch, when not\\r\\notherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the fire, till their\\r\\neyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny features, now all\\r\\nbegrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards, and the contrasting\\r\\nbarbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were strangely revealed in\\r\\nthe capricious emblazonings of the works. As they narrated to each other\\r\\ntheir unholy adventures, their tales of terror told in words of mirth;\\r\\nas their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them, like the\\r\\nflames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their front, the harpooneers\\r\\nwildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers; as the\\r\\nwind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the ship groaned and dived, and\\r\\nyet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness\\r\\nof the sea and the night, and scornfully champed the white bone in\\r\\nher mouth, and viciously spat round her on all sides; then the rushing\\r\\nPequod, freighted with savages, and laden with fire, and burning\\r\\na corpse, and plunging into that blackness of darkness, seemed the\\r\\nmaterial counterpart of her monomaniac commander\\u2019s soul.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently\\r\\nguided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that interval,\\r\\nin darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the madness, the\\r\\nghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend shapes before\\r\\nme, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at last begat kindred\\r\\nvisions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to that unaccountable\\r\\ndrowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)\\r\\nthing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was\\r\\nhorribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller smote\\r\\nmy side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of sails,\\r\\njust beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I\\r\\nwas half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically\\r\\nstretching them still further apart. But, spite of all this, I could see\\r\\nno compass before me to steer by; though it seemed but a minute since I\\r\\nhad been watching the card, by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it.\\r\\nNothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and then made ghastly by\\r\\nflashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression, that whatever swift,\\r\\nrushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as\\r\\nrushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of\\r\\ndeath, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with\\r\\nthe crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,\\r\\ninverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief\\r\\nsleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship\\u2019s stern,\\r\\nwith my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back,\\r\\njust in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and\\r\\nvery probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief from\\r\\nthis unnatural hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of\\r\\nbeing brought by the lee!\\r\\n\\r\\nLook not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy\\r\\nhand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first\\r\\nhint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its\\r\\nredness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,\\r\\nthe skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking\\r\\nflames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the\\r\\nglorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp\\u2014all others but liars!\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless the sun hides not Virginia\\u2019s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome\\u2019s\\r\\naccursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of\\r\\ndeserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,\\r\\nwhich is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this\\r\\nearth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow\\r\\nin him, that mortal man cannot be true\\u2014not true, or undeveloped. With\\r\\nbooks the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and\\r\\nthe truest of all books is Solomon\\u2019s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine\\r\\nhammered steel of woe. \\u201cAll is vanity.\\u201d ALL. This wilful world hath\\r\\nnot got hold of unchristian Solomon\\u2019s wisdom yet. But he who dodges\\r\\nhospitals and jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would\\r\\nrather talk of operas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau,\\r\\npoor devils all of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears\\r\\nby Rabelais as passing wise, and therefore jolly;\\u2014not that man is\\r\\nfitted to sit down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with\\r\\nunfathomably wondrous Solomon.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut even Solomon, he says, \\u201cthe man that wandereth out of the way\\r\\nof understanding shall remain\\u201d (i.e., even while living) \\u201cin the\\r\\ncongregation of the dead.\\u201d Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it\\r\\ninvert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom\\r\\nthat is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a Catskill\\r\\neagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges,\\r\\nand soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces.\\r\\nAnd even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the\\r\\nmountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still\\r\\nhigher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 97. The Lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nHad you descended from the Pequod\\u2019s try-works to the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\nforecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single\\r\\nmoment you would have almost thought you were standing in some\\r\\nilluminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay\\r\\nin their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a\\r\\nscore of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of\\r\\nqueens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in\\r\\ndarkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he\\r\\nseeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an\\r\\nAladdin\\u2019s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest\\r\\nnight the ship\\u2019s black hull still houses an illumination.\\r\\n\\r\\nSee with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of\\r\\nlamps\\u2014often but old bottles and vials, though\\u2014to the copper cooler\\r\\nat the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat.\\r\\nHe burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and,\\r\\ntherefore, unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral\\r\\ncontrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He\\r\\ngoes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and\\r\\ngenuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own\\r\\nsupper of game.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\\r\\ndescried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and\\r\\nslaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside\\r\\nand beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of\\r\\nold to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded\\r\\nsurtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he\\r\\nis condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his\\r\\nspermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;\\u2014but now it\\r\\nremains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by\\r\\nrehearsing\\u2014singing, if I may\\u2014the romantic proceeding of decanting\\r\\noff his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where\\r\\nonce again leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along\\r\\nbeneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the\\r\\nsix-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling\\r\\nthis way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed\\r\\nround and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot\\r\\nacross the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last\\r\\nman-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,\\r\\nrap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, ex officio,\\r\\nevery sailor is a cooper.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great\\r\\nhatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down\\r\\ngo the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are\\r\\nreplaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\\r\\nincidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with\\r\\nfreshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of\\r\\nthe whale\\u2019s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about,\\r\\nas in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the\\r\\nbulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire\\r\\nship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is\\r\\ndeafening.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\\r\\nself-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,\\r\\nyou would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a\\r\\nmost scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses\\r\\na singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never\\r\\nlook so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides,\\r\\nfrom the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is\\r\\nreadily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale\\r\\nremains clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands\\r\\ngo diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags\\r\\nrestore them to their full tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower\\r\\nrigging. All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise\\r\\nfaithfully cleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed\\r\\nupon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of\\r\\nsight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined\\r\\nand simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship\\u2019s company, the\\r\\nwhole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew\\r\\nthemselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to\\r\\ntoe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as\\r\\nbridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and\\r\\nhumorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;\\r\\npropose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not\\r\\nto taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to\\r\\nsuch musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short\\r\\nof audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and\\r\\nbring us napkins!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent\\r\\non spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again\\r\\nsoil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot\\r\\nsomewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest\\r\\nuninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through\\r\\nfor ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their\\r\\nwrists with all day rowing on the Line,\\u2014they only step to the deck to\\r\\ncarry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea,\\r\\nand in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined\\r\\nfires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the\\r\\nheel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the\\r\\nship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor\\r\\nfellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled\\r\\nby the cry of \\u201cThere she blows!\\u201d and away they fly to fight another\\r\\nwhale, and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but\\r\\nthis is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by\\r\\nlong toilings extracted from this world\\u2019s vast bulk its small but\\r\\nvaluable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from\\r\\nits defilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of\\r\\nthe soul; hardly is this done, when\\u2014There she blows!\\u2014the ghost is\\r\\nspouted up, and away we sail to fight some other world, and go through\\r\\nyoung life\\u2019s old routine again.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two\\r\\nthousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with\\r\\nthee along the Peruvian coast last voyage\\u2014and, foolish as I am, taught\\r\\nthee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,\\r\\ntaking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but\\r\\nin the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been\\r\\nadded how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,\\r\\nhe was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely\\r\\neyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the\\r\\nbinnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass,\\r\\nthat glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his\\r\\npurpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast,\\r\\nthen, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin\\r\\nthere, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed\\r\\nwith a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly\\r\\nattracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as\\r\\nthough now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in\\r\\nsome monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some\\r\\ncertain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little\\r\\nworth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by\\r\\nthe cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in\\r\\nthe Milky Way.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the\\r\\nheart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the\\r\\nhead-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all\\r\\nthe rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,\\r\\nuntouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito\\r\\nglow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed\\r\\nby ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick\\r\\ndarkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every\\r\\nsunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was\\r\\nset apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton\\r\\nin their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by\\r\\nnight, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever\\r\\nlive to spend it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun\\r\\nand tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun\\u2019s\\r\\ndisks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,\\r\\nare in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems\\r\\nalmost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by passing\\r\\nthrough those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy example\\r\\nof these things. On its round border it bore the letters, REPUBLICA DEL\\r\\nECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country planted in the\\r\\nmiddle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and named after it;\\r\\nand it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the unwaning clime that\\r\\nknows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three\\r\\nAndes\\u2019 summits; from one a flame; a tower on another; on the third a\\r\\ncrowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned\\r\\nzodiac, the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics, and the\\r\\nkeystone sun entering the equinoctial point at Libra.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now\\r\\npausing.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and\\r\\nall other grand and lofty things; look here,\\u2014three peaks as proud as\\r\\nLucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the\\r\\ncourageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all\\r\\nare Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,\\r\\nwhich, like a magician\\u2019s glass, to each and every man in turn but\\r\\nmirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those\\r\\nwho ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now\\r\\nthis coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign\\r\\nof storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a\\r\\nformer equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in\\r\\nthroes, \\u2018tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So be\\r\\nit, then! Here\\u2019s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil\\u2019s claws must\\r\\nhave left their mouldings there since yesterday,\\u201d murmured Starbuck\\r\\nto himself, leaning against the bulwarks. \\u201cThe old man seems to read\\r\\nBelshazzar\\u2019s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly.\\r\\nHe goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,\\r\\nheaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint\\r\\nearthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over\\r\\nall our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a\\r\\nhope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;\\r\\nbut if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to cheer.\\r\\nYet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we would fain\\r\\nsnatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain! This coin\\r\\nspeaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will quit it,\\r\\nlest Truth shake me falsely.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere now\\u2019s the old Mogul,\\u201d soliloquized Stubb by the try-works,\\r\\n\\u201che\\u2019s been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same,\\r\\nand both with faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine\\r\\nfathoms long. And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have\\r\\nit now on Negro Hill or in Corlaer\\u2019s Hook, I\\u2019d not look at it very\\r\\nlong ere spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard\\r\\nthis as queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your\\r\\ndoubloons of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili,\\r\\nyour doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of\\r\\ngold moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes.\\r\\nWhat then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so\\r\\nkilling wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here\\u2019s\\r\\nsigns and wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome\\r\\ncalls the zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I\\u2019ll get\\r\\nthe almanac and as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll\\u2019s\\r\\narithmetic, I\\u2019ll try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer\\r\\ncurvicues here with the Massachusetts calendar. Here\\u2019s the book.\\r\\nLet\\u2019s see now. Signs and wonders; and the sun, he\\u2019s always among\\r\\n\\u2018em. Hem, hem, hem; here they are\\u2014here they go\\u2014all alive:\\u2014Aries,\\r\\nor the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and Jimimi! here\\u2019s Gemini himself, or\\r\\nthe Twins. Well; the sun he wheels among \\u2018em. Aye, here on the coin\\r\\nhe\\u2019s just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sitting-rooms\\r\\nall in a ring. Book! you lie there; the fact is, you books must know\\r\\nyour places. You\\u2019ll do to give us the bare words and facts, but we\\r\\ncome in to supply the thoughts. That\\u2019s my small experience, so far as\\r\\nthe Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch\\u2019s navigator, and Daboll\\u2019s\\r\\narithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if there is nothing wonderful\\r\\nin signs, and significant in wonders! There\\u2019s a clue somewhere; wait\\r\\na bit; hist\\u2014hark! By Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac\\r\\nhere is the life of man in one round chapter; and now I\\u2019ll read it\\r\\noff, straight out of the book. Come, Almanack! To begin: there\\u2019s\\r\\nAries, or the Ram\\u2014lecherous dog, he begets us; then, Taurus, or the\\r\\nBull\\u2014he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini, or the Twins\\u2014that is,\\r\\nVirtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab,\\r\\nand drags us back; and here, going from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion,\\r\\nlies in the path\\u2014he gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his\\r\\npaw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that\\u2019s our first love;\\r\\nwe marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes Libra, or the\\r\\nScales\\u2014happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we are very sad\\r\\nabout that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion,\\r\\nstings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the\\r\\narrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As\\r\\nwe pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here\\u2019s the battering-ram,\\r\\nCapricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong\\r\\nwe are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole\\r\\ndeluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we\\r\\nsleep. There\\u2019s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes\\r\\nthrough it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty.\\r\\nJollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow\\r\\nhere, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly\\u2019s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon!\\r\\nBut stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the try-works, now,\\r\\nand let\\u2019s hear what he\\u2019ll have to say. There; he\\u2019s before it;\\r\\nhe\\u2019ll out with something presently. So, so; he\\u2019s beginning.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever\\r\\nraises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what\\u2019s\\r\\nall this staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that\\u2019s true;\\r\\nand at two cents the cigar, that\\u2019s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I\\r\\nwon\\u2019t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here\\u2019s\\r\\nnine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy \\u2018em\\r\\nout.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a\\r\\nfoolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort\\r\\nof wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman\\u2014the old\\r\\nhearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He\\r\\nluffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side\\r\\nof the mast; why, there\\u2019s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now\\r\\nhe\\u2019s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he\\u2019s muttering\\u2014voice\\r\\nlike an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when\\r\\nthe sun stands in some one of these signs. I\\u2019ve studied signs, and\\r\\nknow their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the\\r\\nold witch in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The\\r\\nhorse-shoe sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what\\u2019s\\r\\nthe horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign\\u2014the roaring and\\r\\ndevouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men\\r\\nin one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg\\u2014all\\r\\ntattooing\\u2014looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the\\r\\nCannibal? As I live he\\u2019s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;\\r\\nthinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels,\\r\\nI suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon\\u2019s Astronomy in the back\\r\\ncountry. And by Jove, he\\u2019s found something there in the vicinity of\\r\\nhis thigh\\u2014I guess it\\u2019s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don\\u2019t\\r\\nknow what to make of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off\\r\\nsome king\\u2019s trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil,\\r\\nFedallah; tail coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his\\r\\npumps as usual. What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes\\r\\na sign to the sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin\\u2014fire\\r\\nworshipper, depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip\\u2014poor\\r\\nboy! would he had died, or I; he\\u2019s half horrible to me. He too has\\r\\nbeen watching all of these interpreters\\u2014myself included\\u2014and look\\r\\nnow, he comes to read, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again\\r\\nand hear him. Hark!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cUpon my soul, he\\u2019s been studying Murray\\u2019s Grammar! Improving his\\r\\nmind, poor fellow! But what\\u2019s that he says now\\u2014hist!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, he\\u2019s getting it by heart\\u2014hist! again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, that\\u2019s funny.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I\\u2019m a\\r\\ncrow, especially when I stand a\\u2019top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!\\r\\ncaw! caw! caw! caw! Ain\\u2019t I a crow? And where\\u2019s the scare-crow?\\r\\nThere he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two\\r\\nmore poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWonder if he means me?\\u2014complimentary!\\u2014poor lad!\\u2014I could go hang\\r\\nmyself. Any way, for the present, I\\u2019ll quit Pip\\u2019s vicinity. I can\\r\\nstand the rest, for they have plain wits; but he\\u2019s too crazy-witty for\\r\\nmy sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHere\\u2019s the ship\\u2019s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all\\r\\non fire to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what\\u2019s the\\r\\nconsequence? Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when\\r\\naught\\u2019s nailed to the mast it\\u2019s a sign that things grow desperate.\\r\\nHa, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he\\u2019ll nail ye! This is a pine tree.\\r\\nMy father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a\\r\\nsilver ring grown over in it; some old darkey\\u2019s wedding ring. How did\\r\\nit get there? And so they\\u2019ll say in the resurrection, when they come\\r\\nto fish up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded\\r\\noysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold!\\r\\nthe green miser\\u2019ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes \\u2018mong the\\r\\nworlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey,\\r\\nhey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm. The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel\\r\\nEnderby, of London.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cShip, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSo cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing\\r\\ndown under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was standing in his\\r\\nhoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger\\r\\ncaptain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat\\u2019s bow. He was\\r\\na darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of sixty or\\r\\nthereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round him in\\r\\nfestoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket streamed\\r\\nbehind him like the broidered arm of a hussar\\u2019s surcoat.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHast seen the White Whale!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSee you this?\\u201d and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden\\r\\nit, he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden\\r\\nhead like a mallet.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMan my boat!\\u201d cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars\\r\\nnear him\\u2014\\u201cStand by to lower!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his\\r\\ncrew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the stranger.\\r\\nBut here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the excitement of the\\r\\nmoment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never\\r\\nonce stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own, and then it was\\r\\nalways by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to\\r\\nthe Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other\\r\\nvessel at a moment\\u2019s warning. Now, it is no very easy matter\\r\\nfor anybody\\u2014except those who are almost hourly used to it, like\\r\\nwhalemen\\u2014to clamber up a ship\\u2019s side from a boat on the open sea;\\r\\nfor the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and\\r\\nthen instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So, deprived\\r\\nof one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied\\r\\nwith the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a\\r\\nclumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height\\r\\nhe could hardly hope to attain.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward\\r\\ncircumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his\\r\\nluckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And\\r\\nin the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\\r\\ntwo officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\\r\\nperpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\\r\\npair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\\r\\nto bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to\\r\\nuse their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,\\r\\nbecause the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,\\r\\ncried out, \\u201cI see, I see!\\u2014avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing\\r\\nover the cutting-tackle.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two\\r\\nprevious, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive curved\\r\\nblubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end. This\\r\\nwas quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all, slid his\\r\\nsolitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting in the\\r\\nfluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the\\r\\nword, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his\\r\\nown weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of\\r\\nthe tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and\\r\\ngently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust\\r\\nforth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his\\r\\nivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades)\\r\\ncried out in his walrus way, \\u201cAye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones\\r\\ntogether!\\u2014an arm and a leg!\\u2014an arm that never can shrink, d\\u2019ye\\r\\nsee; and a leg that never can run. Where did\\u2019st thou see the White\\r\\nWhale?\\u2014how long ago?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe White Whale,\\u201d said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm\\r\\ntowards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been\\r\\na telescope; \\u201cthere I saw him, on the Line, last season.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd he took that arm off, did he?\\u201d asked Ahab, now sliding down\\r\\nfrom the capstan, and resting on the Englishman\\u2019s shoulder, as he did\\r\\nso.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSpin me the yarn,\\u201d said Ahab; \\u201chow was it?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\\u201d\\r\\nbegan the Englishman. \\u201cI was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.\\r\\nWell, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat\\r\\nfastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went\\r\\nmilling and milling round so, that my boat\\u2019s crew could only trim\\r\\ndish, by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up\\r\\nbreaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a\\r\\nmilky-white head and hump, all crows\\u2019 feet and wrinkles.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt was he, it was he!\\u201d cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his\\r\\nsuspended breath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye\\u2014they were mine\\u2014my irons,\\u201d cried Ahab,\\r\\nexultingly\\u2014\\u201cbut on!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGive me a chance, then,\\u201d said the Englishman, good-humoredly.\\r\\n\\u201cWell, this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs\\r\\nall afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, I see!\\u2014wanted to part it; free the fast-fish\\u2014an old\\r\\ntrick\\u2014I know him.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow it was exactly,\\u201d continued the one-armed commander, \\u201cI do\\r\\nnot know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there\\r\\nsomehow; but we didn\\u2019t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled\\r\\non the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters\\r\\nstood, and what a noble great whale it was\\u2014the noblest and biggest\\r\\nI ever saw, sir, in my life\\u2014I resolved to capture him, spite of the\\r\\nboiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would\\r\\nget loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a devil\\r\\nof a boat\\u2019s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I say,\\r\\nI jumped into my first mate\\u2019s boat\\u2014Mr. Mounttop\\u2019s here (by the\\r\\nway, Captain\\u2014Mounttop; Mounttop\\u2014the captain);\\u2014as I was saying,\\r\\nI jumped into Mounttop\\u2019s boat, which, d\\u2019ye see, was gunwale and\\r\\ngunwale with mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old\\r\\ngreat-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir\\u2014hearts and souls\\r\\nalive, man\\u2014the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat\\u2014both\\r\\neyes out\\u2014all befogged and bedeadened with black foam\\u2014the whale\\u2019s\\r\\ntail looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like\\r\\na marble steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at\\r\\nmidday, with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say,\\r\\nafter the second iron, to toss it overboard\\u2014down comes the tail like a\\r\\nLima tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,\\r\\nflukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was\\r\\nall chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I seized\\r\\nhold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung to that\\r\\nlike a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at the same\\r\\ninstant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down like a\\r\\nflash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me\\r\\ncaught me here\\u201d (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); \\u201cyes,\\r\\ncaught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell\\u2019s flames, I was\\r\\nthinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb ript\\r\\nits way along the flesh\\u2014clear along the whole length of my arm\\u2014came\\r\\nout nigh my wrist, and up I floated;\\u2014and that gentleman there will\\r\\ntell you the rest (by the way, captain\\u2014Dr. Bunger, ship\\u2019s surgeon:\\r\\nBunger, my lad,\\u2014the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the\\r\\nyarn.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all the\\r\\ntime standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote his\\r\\ngentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but sober\\r\\none; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and patched\\r\\ntrowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between a\\r\\nmarlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,\\r\\noccasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two\\r\\ncrippled captains. But, at his superior\\u2019s introduction of him to\\r\\nAhab, he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain\\u2019s\\r\\nbidding.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt was a shocking bad wound,\\u201d began the whale-surgeon; \\u201cand,\\r\\ntaking my advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSamuel Enderby is the name of my ship,\\u201d interrupted the one-armed\\r\\ncaptain, addressing Ahab; \\u201cgo on, boy.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing\\r\\nhot weather there on the Line. But it was no use\\u2014I did all I could;\\r\\nsat up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of\\r\\ndiet\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, very severe!\\u201d chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly\\r\\naltering his voice, \\u201cDrinking hot rum toddies with me every night,\\r\\ntill he couldn\\u2019t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed,\\r\\nhalf seas over, about three o\\u2019clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars!\\r\\nhe sat up with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great\\r\\nwatcher, and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog,\\r\\nlaugh out! why don\\u2019t ye? You know you\\u2019re a precious jolly rascal.)\\r\\nBut, heave ahead, boy, I\\u2019d rather be killed by you than kept alive by\\r\\nany other man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir\\u201d\\u2014said\\r\\nthe imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab\\u2014\\u201cis\\r\\napt to be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that\\r\\nsort. But I may as well say\\u2014en passant, as the French remark\\u2014that I\\r\\nmyself\\u2014that is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy\\u2014am a\\r\\nstrict total abstinence man; I never drink\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWater!\\u201d cried the captain; \\u201che never drinks it; it\\u2019s a sort of\\r\\nfits to him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on\\u2014go\\r\\non with the arm story.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, I may as well,\\u201d said the surgeon, coolly. \\u201cI was about\\r\\nobserving, sir, before Captain Boomer\\u2019s facetious interruption, that\\r\\nspite of my best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse\\r\\nand worse; the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon\\r\\never saw; more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with\\r\\nthe lead line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and\\r\\noff it came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there;\\r\\nthat thing is against all rule\\u201d\\u2014pointing at it with the\\r\\nmarlingspike\\u2014\\u201cthat is the captain\\u2019s work, not mine; he ordered the\\r\\ncarpenter to make it; he had that club-hammer there put to the end, to\\r\\nknock some one\\u2019s brains out with, I suppose, as he tried mine once.\\r\\nHe flies into diabolical passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent,\\r\\nsir\\u201d\\u2014removing his hat, and brushing aside his hair, and exposing a\\r\\nbowl-like cavity in his skull, but which bore not the slightest scarry\\r\\ntrace, or any token of ever having been a wound\\u2014\\u201cWell, the captain\\r\\nthere will tell you how that came here; he knows.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, I don\\u2019t,\\u201d said the captain, \\u201cbut his mother did; he was\\r\\nborn with it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you\\u2014you Bunger! was there ever\\r\\nsuch another Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought\\r\\nto die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you\\r\\nrascal.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat became of the White Whale?\\u201d now cried Ahab, who thus far had\\r\\nbeen impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh!\\u201d cried the one-armed captain, \\u201coh, yes! Well; after he\\r\\nsounded, we didn\\u2019t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before\\r\\nhinted, I didn\\u2019t then know what whale it was that had served me such a\\r\\ntrick, till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard\\r\\nabout Moby Dick\\u2014as some call him\\u2014and then I knew it was he.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDid\\u2019st thou cross his wake again?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTwice.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut could not fasten?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDidn\\u2019t want to try to: ain\\u2019t one limb enough? What should I do\\r\\nwithout this other arm? And I\\u2019m thinking Moby Dick doesn\\u2019t bite so\\r\\nmuch as he swallows.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, then,\\u201d interrupted Bunger, \\u201cgive him your left arm for\\r\\nbait to get the right. Do you know, gentlemen\\u201d\\u2014very gravely and\\r\\nmathematically bowing to each Captain in succession\\u2014\\u201cDo you know,\\r\\ngentlemen, that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably\\r\\nconstructed by Divine Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to\\r\\ncompletely digest even a man\\u2019s arm? And he knows it too. So that what\\r\\nyou take for the White Whale\\u2019s malice is only his awkwardness. For\\r\\nhe never means to swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by\\r\\nfeints. But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a\\r\\npatient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once\\r\\nupon a time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed\\r\\nfor a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it\\r\\nup in small tacks, d\\u2019ye see. No possible way for him to digest that\\r\\njack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.\\r\\nYes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind\\r\\nto pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial\\r\\nto the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have\\r\\nanother chance at you shortly, that\\u2019s all.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, thank ye, Bunger,\\u201d said the English Captain, \\u201che\\u2019s welcome\\r\\nto the arm he has, since I can\\u2019t help it, and didn\\u2019t know him then;\\r\\nbut not to another one. No more White Whales for me; I\\u2019ve lowered\\r\\nfor him once, and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in\\r\\nkilling him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm\\r\\nin him, but, hark ye, he\\u2019s best let alone; don\\u2019t you think so,\\r\\nCaptain?\\u201d\\u2014glancing at the ivory leg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let\\r\\nalone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He\\u2019s all\\r\\na magnet! How long since thou saw\\u2019st him last? Which way heading?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBless my soul, and curse the foul fiend\\u2019s,\\u201d cried Bunger,\\r\\nstoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing;\\r\\n\\u201cthis man\\u2019s blood\\u2014bring the thermometer!\\u2014it\\u2019s at the boiling\\r\\npoint!\\u2014his pulse makes these planks beat!\\u2014sir!\\u201d\\u2014taking a lancet\\r\\nfrom his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab\\u2019s arm.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast!\\u201d roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks\\u2014\\u201cMan the\\r\\nboat! Which way heading?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood God!\\u201d cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s the matter? He was heading east, I think.\\u2014Is your Captain\\r\\ncrazy?\\u201d whispering Fedallah.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to\\r\\ntake the boat\\u2019s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle\\r\\ntowards him, commanded the ship\\u2019s sailors to stand by to lower.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a moment he was standing in the boat\\u2019s stern, and the Manilla men\\r\\nwere springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him.\\r\\nWith back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,\\r\\nAhab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 101. The Decanter.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that\\r\\nshe hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,\\r\\nmerchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of\\r\\nEnderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman\\u2019s opinion, comes not\\r\\nfar behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point\\r\\nof real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our\\r\\nLord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous\\r\\nfish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted\\r\\nout the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;\\r\\nthough for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant\\r\\nCoffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets\\r\\npursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not\\r\\nelsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were\\r\\nthe first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm\\r\\nWhale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the\\r\\nwhole globe who so harpooned him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,\\r\\nand at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\\r\\nHorn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any\\r\\nsort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;\\r\\nand returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,\\r\\nthe Amelia\\u2019s example was soon followed by other ships, English and\\r\\nAmerican, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were\\r\\nthrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable\\r\\nhouse again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons\\u2014how many, their\\r\\nmother only knows\\u2014and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I\\r\\nthink, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the\\r\\nsloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South\\r\\nSea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling\\r\\nvoyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this\\r\\nis not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of\\r\\ntheir own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That\\r\\nship\\u2014well called the \\u201cSyren\\u201d\\u2014made a noble experimental cruise;\\r\\nand it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became\\r\\ngenerally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a\\r\\nCaptain Coffin, a Nantucketer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll honour to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to\\r\\nthe present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have\\r\\nslipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship named after him was worthy of the honour, being a very fast\\r\\nsailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight\\r\\nsomewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\\r\\nforecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps\\u2014every\\r\\nsoul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine\\r\\ngam I had\\u2014long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his\\r\\nivory heel\\u2014it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that\\r\\nship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever\\r\\nlose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it at\\r\\nthe rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it\\u2019s\\r\\nsqually off there by Patagonia), and all hands\\u2014visitors and all\\u2014were\\r\\ncalled to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each\\r\\nother aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our\\r\\njackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the\\r\\nhowling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts\\r\\ndid not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we\\r\\nhad to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down\\r\\nthe forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to my\\r\\ntaste.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe beef was fine\\u2014tough, but with body in it. They said it was\\r\\nbull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\\r\\ncertain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\\r\\nsymmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you\\r\\ncould feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed.\\r\\nIf you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out of\\r\\nyou like billiard-balls. The bread\\u2014but that couldn\\u2019t be helped;\\r\\nbesides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread contained the\\r\\nonly fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very light, and it\\r\\nwas very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it. But all\\r\\nin all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the dimensions of\\r\\nthe cook\\u2019s boilers, including his own live parchment boilers; fore\\r\\nand aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of good fare and\\r\\nplenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and capital from boot\\r\\nheels to hat-band.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other\\r\\nEnglish whalers I know of\\u2014not all though\\u2014were such famous,\\r\\nhospitable ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the\\r\\ncan, and the joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and\\r\\nlaughing? I will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English\\r\\nwhalers is matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all\\r\\nsparing of historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\\r\\nZealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant\\r\\nin the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,\\r\\ntouching plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English\\r\\nmerchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in\\r\\nthe English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural,\\r\\nbut incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some special\\r\\norigin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\\r\\nancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew\\r\\nmust be about whalers. The title was, \\u201cDan Coopman,\\u201d wherefore I\\r\\nconcluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\\r\\ncooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was\\r\\nreinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\\r\\n\\u201cFitz Swackhammer.\\u201d But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,\\r\\nprofessor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and\\r\\nSt. Pott\\u2019s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a\\r\\nbox of sperm candles for his trouble\\u2014this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon\\r\\nas he spied the book, assured me that \\u201cDan Coopman\\u201d did not mean\\r\\n\\u201cThe Cooper,\\u201d but \\u201cThe Merchant.\\u201d In short, this ancient and\\r\\nlearned Low Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among\\r\\nother subjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale\\r\\nfishery. And in this chapter it was, headed, \\u201cSmeer,\\u201d or \\u201cFat,\\u201d\\r\\nthat I found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and\\r\\ncellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by\\r\\nDr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock\\r\\nfish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins\\r\\nof butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese\\r\\n(probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of\\r\\nbeer.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in\\r\\nthe present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,\\r\\nbarrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all\\r\\nthis beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\\r\\nincidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic\\r\\napplication; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my\\r\\nown, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by\\r\\nevery Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen\\r\\nwhale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\\r\\nLeyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\\r\\nnaturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\\r\\nnature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\\r\\nin those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country\\r\\nwhere the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\\r\\npolar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\\r\\nclimate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\\r\\nincluding the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much\\r\\nexceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet\\r\\nof 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say,\\r\\nwe have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks\\u2019\\r\\nallowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.\\r\\nNow, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might\\r\\nfancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in\\r\\na boat\\u2019s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem\\r\\nsomewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But\\r\\nthis was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with\\r\\nthe constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would\\r\\nbe apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his\\r\\nboat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers\\r\\nof two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English\\r\\nwhalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when\\r\\ncruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the\\r\\nworld, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the\\r\\ndecanter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides.\\r\\n\\r\\nHitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly\\r\\ndwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail\\r\\nupon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough\\r\\nsweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still\\r\\nfurther, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,\\r\\nand casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost\\r\\nbones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his\\r\\nunconditional skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the\\r\\nfishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the\\r\\nwhale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures\\r\\non the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a\\r\\nspecimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land\\r\\na full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a\\r\\nroast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,\\r\\nIshmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;\\r\\nthe privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,\\r\\nridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of\\r\\nleviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and\\r\\ncheeseries in his bowels.\\r\\n\\r\\nI confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far\\r\\nbeneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed\\r\\nwith an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged\\r\\nto, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his\\r\\npoke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the\\r\\nheads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my\\r\\nboat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the\\r\\ncontents of that young cub?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their\\r\\ngigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted\\r\\nto my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.\\r\\nFor being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey\\r\\nof Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with\\r\\nthe lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side\\r\\nglen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his\\r\\ncapital.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted\\r\\nwith a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought\\r\\ntogether in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his\\r\\npeople could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,\\r\\nchiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes;\\r\\nand all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the\\r\\nwonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an\\r\\nunusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his\\r\\nhead against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings\\r\\nseemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of\\r\\nits fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,\\r\\nthen the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where a\\r\\ngrand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebrae were carved with\\r\\nArsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests\\r\\nkept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head\\r\\nagain sent forth its vapoury spout; while, suspended from a bough, the\\r\\nterrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung\\r\\nsword that so affrighted Damocles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy\\r\\nGlen; the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the\\r\\nindustrious earth beneath was as a weaver\\u2019s loom, with a gorgeous\\r\\ncarpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and woof,\\r\\nand the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their laden\\r\\nbranches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the message-carrying\\r\\nair; all these unceasingly were active. Through the lacings of the\\r\\nleaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied\\r\\nverdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!\\u2014pause!\\u2014one word!\\u2014whither\\r\\nflows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all these ceaseless\\r\\ntoilings? Speak, weaver!\\u2014stay thy hand!\\u2014but one single word with\\r\\nthee! Nay\\u2014the shuttle flies\\u2014the figures float from forth the loom;\\r\\nthe freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god, he\\r\\nweaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal\\r\\nvoice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;\\r\\nand only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak\\r\\nthrough it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken\\r\\nwords that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words\\r\\nare plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened casements.\\r\\nThereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be heedful; for\\r\\nso, in all this din of the great world\\u2019s loom, thy subtlest thinkings\\r\\nmay be overheard afar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the\\r\\ngreat, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging\\u2014a gigantic idler! Yet,\\r\\nas the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around\\r\\nhim, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven\\r\\nover with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but\\r\\nhimself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim\\r\\ngod wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the\\r\\nskull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real\\r\\njet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as\\r\\nan object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests\\r\\nshould swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced\\r\\nbefore this skeleton\\u2014brushed the vines aside\\u2014broke through the\\r\\nribs\\u2014and with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid\\r\\nits many winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was\\r\\nout; and following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered.\\r\\nI saw no living thing within; naught was there but bones.\\r\\n\\r\\nCutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the skeleton.\\r\\nFrom their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me taking the\\r\\naltitude of the final rib, \\u201cHow now!\\u201d they shouted; \\u201cDar\\u2019st thou\\r\\nmeasure this our god! That\\u2019s for us.\\u201d \\u201cAye, priests\\u2014well, how\\r\\nlong do ye make him, then?\\u201d But hereupon a fierce contest rose among\\r\\nthem, concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other\\u2019s sconces\\r\\nwith their yard-sticks\\u2014the great skull echoed\\u2014and seizing that lucky\\r\\nchance, I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be\\r\\nit recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied\\r\\nmeasurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can\\r\\nrefer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell\\r\\nme, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where\\r\\nthey have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise, I\\r\\nhave heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they have\\r\\nwhat the proprietors call \\u201cthe only perfect specimen of a Greenland or\\r\\nRiver Whale in the United States.\\u201d Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire,\\r\\nEngland, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has\\r\\nin his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of moderate size,\\r\\nby no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend King Tranquo\\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons\\r\\nbelonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar\\r\\ngrounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir\\r\\nClifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir\\r\\nClifford\\u2019s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a\\r\\ngreat chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony\\r\\ncavities\\u2014spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan\\u2014and swing all day\\r\\nupon his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and\\r\\nshutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of\\r\\nkeys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at\\r\\nthe whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the echo\\r\\nin the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view\\r\\nfrom his forehead.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied\\r\\nverbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild\\r\\nwanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving\\r\\nsuch valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished\\r\\nthe other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then\\r\\ncomposing\\u2014at least, what untattooed parts might remain\\u2014I did not\\r\\ntrouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all\\r\\nenter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale\\u2019s Skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain\\r\\nstatement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton we\\r\\nare briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base\\r\\nupon Captain Scoresby\\u2019s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest\\r\\nsized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\\r\\ncalculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\\r\\neighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\\r\\nfeet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\\r\\nninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would\\r\\nconsiderably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one\\r\\nthousand one hundred inhabitants.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this\\r\\nleviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman\\u2019s imagination?\\r\\n\\r\\nHaving already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\\r\\njaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\\r\\nsimply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\\r\\nunobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large\\r\\na proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\\r\\nmost complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in\\r\\nthis chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your\\r\\narm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the\\r\\ngeneral structure we are about to view.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn length, the Sperm Whale\\u2019s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\\r\\nFeet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\\r\\nbeen ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\\r\\nfifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet,\\r\\nhis skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of\\r\\nplain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a\\r\\nthird of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once\\r\\nenclosed his vitals.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\\r\\nextending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\\r\\nthe hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty\\r\\nof her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the\\r\\ntime, but a long, disconnected timber.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck,\\r\\nwas nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\\r\\nsuccessively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\\r\\nof the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\\r\\nthat part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\\r\\nspanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\\r\\na seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\\r\\narched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\\r\\nfootpath bridges over small streams.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\\r\\ncircumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\\r\\nthe whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\\r\\nthe Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish\\r\\nwhich, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the\\r\\ninvested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen\\r\\nfeet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight\\r\\nfeet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the\\r\\nliving magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw\\r\\nbut a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of\\r\\nadded bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the\\r\\nample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the\\r\\nweighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\\r\\n\\r\\nHow vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\\r\\nto comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead\\r\\nattenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the\\r\\nheart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry\\r\\nflukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale\\r\\nbe truly and livingly found out.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\\r\\ncrane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\\r\\nit\\u2019s done, it looks much like Pompey\\u2019s Pillar.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are\\r\\nnot locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on\\r\\na Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest,\\r\\na middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\\r\\nmore than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\\r\\ntail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\\r\\nbilliard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\\r\\nhad been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest\\u2019s children,\\r\\nwho had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the\\r\\nspine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple\\r\\nchild\\u2019s play.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon\\r\\nto enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not\\r\\ncompress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial\\r\\nfolio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail,\\r\\nand the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic\\r\\ninvolutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great\\r\\ncables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a\\r\\nline-of-battle-ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me\\r\\nto approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not\\r\\noverlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him\\r\\nout to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him\\r\\nin most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it\\r\\nnow remains to magnify him in an archaeological, fossiliferous, and\\r\\nantediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the\\r\\nLeviathan\\u2014to an ant or a flea\\u2014such portly terms might justly be\\r\\ndeemed unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text,\\r\\nthe case is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the\\r\\nweightiest words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that\\r\\nwhenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these\\r\\ndissertations, I have invariably used a huge quarto edition of\\r\\nJohnson, expressly purchased for that purpose; because that famous\\r\\nlexicographer\\u2019s uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a\\r\\nlexicon to be used by a whale author like me.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,\\r\\nthough it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing\\r\\nof this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard\\r\\ncapitals. Give me a condor\\u2019s quill! Give me Vesuvius\\u2019 crater for\\r\\nan inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my\\r\\nthoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their\\r\\noutreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole\\r\\ncircle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and\\r\\nmastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas\\r\\nof empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding its\\r\\nsuburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and liberal\\r\\ntheme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you must choose\\r\\na mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be written on the\\r\\nflea, though many there be who have tried it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my credentials\\r\\nas a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I have been\\r\\na stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and wells,\\r\\nwine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by way of\\r\\npreliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the earlier\\r\\ngeological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost\\r\\ncompletely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are called\\r\\nthe Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate intercepted\\r\\nlinks, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose remote\\r\\nposterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil Whales\\r\\nhitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the last\\r\\npreceding the superficial formations. And though none of them\\r\\nprecisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet\\r\\nsufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking\\r\\nrank as Cetacean fossils.\\r\\n\\r\\nDetached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones\\r\\nand skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been\\r\\nfound at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in\\r\\nScotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\\r\\nAmong the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the\\r\\nyear 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street\\r\\nopening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones\\r\\ndisinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon\\u2019s\\r\\ntime. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly\\r\\nunknown Leviathanic species.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost\\r\\ncomplete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842, on\\r\\nthe plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken credulous\\r\\nslaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen\\r\\nangels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and bestowed\\r\\nupon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of it being\\r\\ntaken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned out\\r\\nthat this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed species. A\\r\\nsignificant illustration of the fact, again and again repeated in this\\r\\nbook, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the\\r\\nshape of his fully invested body. So Owen rechristened the monster\\r\\nZeuglodon; and in his paper read before the London Geological Society,\\r\\npronounced it, in substance, one of the most extraordinary creatures\\r\\nwhich the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,\\r\\njaws, ribs, and vertebrae, all characterized by partial resemblances to\\r\\nthe existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on\\r\\nthe other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical\\r\\nLeviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back\\r\\nto that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for\\r\\ntime began with man. Here Saturn\\u2019s grey chaos rolls over me, and I\\r\\nobtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when wedged\\r\\nbastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and in all\\r\\nthe 25,000 miles of this world\\u2019s circumference, not an inhabitable\\r\\nhand\\u2019s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world was the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the present\\r\\nlines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree like\\r\\nLeviathan? Ahab\\u2019s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh\\u2019s.\\r\\nMethuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem.\\r\\nI am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the\\r\\nunspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,\\r\\nmust needs exist after all humane ages are over.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the\\r\\nstereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his\\r\\nancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim\\r\\nfor them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable\\r\\nprint of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah,\\r\\nsome fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a\\r\\nsculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins, and\\r\\ndolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the\\r\\nmoderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was there\\r\\nswimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was cradled.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity\\r\\nof the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by\\r\\nthe venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNot far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams\\r\\nof which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are\\r\\noftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine, that\\r\\nby a secret Power bestowed by God upon the temple, no Whale can pass it\\r\\nwithout immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that on either\\r\\nside of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into the Sea,\\r\\nand wound the Whales when they light upon \\u2018em. They keep a Whale\\u2019s\\r\\nRib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the Ground\\r\\nwith its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which cannot\\r\\nbe reached by a Man upon a Camel\\u2019s Back. This Rib (says John Leo)\\r\\nis said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their\\r\\nHistorians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy\\u2019d of Mahomet, came from\\r\\nthis Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas was\\r\\ncast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a\\r\\nNantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 105. Does the Whale\\u2019s Magnitude Diminish?\\u2014Will He Perish?\\r\\n\\r\\nInasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from\\r\\nthe head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,\\r\\nin the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the\\r\\noriginal bulk of his sires.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the\\r\\npresent day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are\\r\\nfound in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period\\r\\nprior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those\\r\\nbelonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier\\r\\nones.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the\\r\\nAlabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than\\r\\nseventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,\\r\\nthat the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large\\r\\nsized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen\\u2019s authority, that\\r\\nSperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of\\r\\ncapture.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an\\r\\nadvance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may\\r\\nit not be, that since Adam\\u2019s time they have degenerated?\\r\\n\\r\\nAssuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such\\r\\ngentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny\\r\\ntells us of Whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus\\r\\nof others which measured eight hundred feet in length\\u2014Rope Walks and\\r\\nThames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander,\\r\\nCooke\\u2019s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of\\r\\nSciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled\\r\\nBellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and\\r\\nsixty feet. And Lacepede, the French naturalist, in his elaborate\\r\\nhistory of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down\\r\\nthe Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight\\r\\nfeet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is\\r\\nas big as his ancestors in Pliny\\u2019s time. And if ever I go where Pliny\\r\\nis, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.\\r\\nBecause I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies\\r\\nthat were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not\\r\\nmeasure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;\\r\\nand while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian\\r\\nand Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are\\r\\ndrawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle\\r\\nof Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest\\r\\nof Pharaoh\\u2019s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that\\r\\nof all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more\\r\\nrecondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs\\r\\nat the mast-heads of the whaleships, now penetrating even through\\r\\nBehring\\u2019s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers\\r\\nof the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all\\r\\ncontinental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure\\r\\nso wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last\\r\\nbe exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man,\\r\\nsmoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.\\r\\n\\r\\nComparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,\\r\\nwhich, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the prairies\\r\\nof Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and scowled with\\r\\ntheir thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous river-capitals,\\r\\nwhere now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch; in such\\r\\na comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished, to show that\\r\\nthe hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a\\r\\nperiod ago\\u2014not a good lifetime\\u2014the census of the buffalo in Illinois\\r\\nexceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day\\r\\nnot one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the\\r\\ncause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far\\r\\ndifferent nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an\\r\\nend to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales for\\r\\nforty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank God,\\r\\nif at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the days\\r\\nof the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West, when\\r\\nthe far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness and\\r\\na virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of\\r\\nmonths, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain\\r\\nnot forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need\\r\\nwere, could be statistically stated.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the\\r\\ngradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former years\\r\\n(the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in\\r\\nsmall pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in\\r\\nconsequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more\\r\\nremunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,\\r\\ninfluenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense\\r\\ncaravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and\\r\\npods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely\\r\\nseparated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally fallacious seems\\r\\nthe conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer\\r\\nhaunt many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that\\r\\nspecies also is declining. For they are only being driven from\\r\\npromontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with\\r\\ntheir jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very\\r\\nrecently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two\\r\\nfirm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain\\r\\nimpregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss\\r\\nhave retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and\\r\\nglades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to\\r\\ntheir Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and\\r\\nwalls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle\\r\\nof everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one\\r\\ncachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this\\r\\npositive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.\\r\\nBut though for some time past a number of these whales, not less\\r\\nthan 13,000, have been annually slain on the nor\\u2019-west coast by the\\r\\nAmericans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this\\r\\ncircumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this\\r\\nmatter.\\r\\n\\r\\nNatural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness\\r\\nof the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to\\r\\nHarto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the\\r\\nKing of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are\\r\\nnumerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems no\\r\\nreason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted for\\r\\nthousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all the\\r\\nsuccessive monarchs of the East\\u2014if they still survive there in great\\r\\nnumbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since he\\r\\nhas a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as all\\r\\nAsia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the Isles\\r\\nof the sea combined.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity\\r\\nof whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,\\r\\ntherefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations\\r\\nmust be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea\\r\\nof, by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of\\r\\ncreation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and children\\r\\nwho were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this countless host to\\r\\nthe present human population of the globe.\\r\\n\\r\\nWherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his\\r\\nspecies, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas\\r\\nbefore the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the\\r\\nTuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah\\u2019s flood he\\r\\ndespised Noah\\u2019s Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded,\\r\\nlike the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will\\r\\nstill survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial\\r\\nflood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 106. Ahab\\u2019s Leg.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel\\r\\nEnderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to\\r\\nhis own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his\\r\\nboat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And\\r\\nwhen after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so\\r\\nvehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it\\r\\nwas, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough); then,\\r\\nthe already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench,\\r\\nthat though it still remained entire, and to all appearances lusty, yet\\r\\nAhab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his\\r\\npervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the\\r\\ncondition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not\\r\\nbeen very long prior to the Pequod\\u2019s sailing from Nantucket, that he\\r\\nhad been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;\\r\\nby some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his\\r\\nivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise\\r\\nsmitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme\\r\\ndifficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all\\r\\nthe anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a\\r\\nformer woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most poisonous\\r\\nreptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest\\r\\nsongster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity, all miserable\\r\\nevents do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than equally, thought\\r\\nAhab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the\\r\\nancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is\\r\\nan inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural\\r\\nenjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,\\r\\nbut, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of\\r\\nall hell\\u2019s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still\\r\\nfertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs\\r\\nbeyond the grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an\\r\\ninequality in the deeper analysis of the thing. For, thought Ahab, while\\r\\neven the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying\\r\\npettiness lurking in them, but, at bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic\\r\\nsignificance, and, in some men, an archangelic grandeur; so do their\\r\\ndiligent tracings-out not belie the obvious deduction. To trail the\\r\\ngenealogies of these high mortal miseries, carries us at last among the\\r\\nsourceless primogenitures of the gods; so that, in the face of all the\\r\\nglad, hay-making suns, and soft cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must\\r\\nneeds give in to this: that the gods themselves are not for ever glad.\\r\\nThe ineffaceable, sad birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of\\r\\nsorrow in the signers.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more\\r\\nproperly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other\\r\\nparticulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,\\r\\nwhy it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the sailing\\r\\nof the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such Grand-Lama-like\\r\\nexclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought speechless refuge, as\\r\\nit were, among the marble senate of the dead. Captain Peleg\\u2019s bruited\\r\\nreason for this thing appeared by no means adequate; though, indeed,\\r\\nas touching all Ahab\\u2019s deeper part, every revelation partook more of\\r\\nsignificant darkness than of explanatory light. But, in the end, it all\\r\\ncame out; this one matter did, at least. That direful mishap was at\\r\\nthe bottom of his temporary recluseness. And not only this, but to that\\r\\never-contracting, dropping circle ashore, who, for any reason, possessed\\r\\nthe privilege of a less banned approach to him; to that timid circle the\\r\\nabove hinted casualty\\u2014remaining, as it did, moodily unaccounted for\\r\\nby Ahab\\u2014invested itself with terrors, not entirely underived from the\\r\\nland of spirits and of wails. So that, through their zeal for him, they\\r\\nhad all conspired, so far as in them lay, to muffle up the knowledge of\\r\\nthis thing from others; and hence it was, that not till a considerable\\r\\ninterval had elapsed, did it transpire upon the Pequod\\u2019s decks.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,\\r\\nor the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not\\r\\nwith earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took plain\\r\\npractical procedures;\\u2014he called the carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without delay\\r\\nset about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him supplied\\r\\nwith all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which had thus\\r\\nfar been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful selection\\r\\nof the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured. This done, the\\r\\ncarpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night; and to\\r\\nprovide all the fittings for it, independent of those pertaining to the\\r\\ndistrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship\\u2019s forge was ordered to be\\r\\nhoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and, to accelerate\\r\\nthe affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the\\r\\nforging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high\\r\\nabstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But\\r\\nfrom the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they\\r\\nseem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.\\r\\nBut most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of\\r\\nthe high, humane abstraction; the Pequod\\u2019s carpenter was no duplicate;\\r\\nhence, he now comes in person on this stage.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging\\r\\nto whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,\\r\\nalike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own;\\r\\nthe carpenter\\u2019s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of\\r\\nall those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood\\r\\nas an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of the\\r\\ngeneric remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly\\r\\nefficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually\\r\\nrecurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years\\u2019 voyage, in\\r\\nuncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in\\r\\nordinary duties:\\u2014repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the\\r\\nshape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull\\u2019s eyes in the deck, or\\r\\nnew tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters\\r\\nmore directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover\\r\\nunhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both\\r\\nuseful and capricious.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\\r\\nwas his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several\\r\\nvices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times\\r\\nexcept when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed\\r\\nathwartships against the rear of the Try-works.\\r\\n\\r\\nA belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:\\r\\nthe carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and straightway\\r\\nfiles it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage strays on board,\\r\\nand is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of right-whale bone, and\\r\\ncross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter makes a pagoda-looking\\r\\ncage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the carpenter concocts a\\r\\nsoothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon\\r\\nthe blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his big vice of wood,\\r\\nthe carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes\\r\\na fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.\\r\\nAnother has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping\\r\\none hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow\\r\\nunmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation; whirling round the\\r\\nhandle of his wooden vice, the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in\\r\\nthat, if he would have him draw the tooth.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent\\r\\nand without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he\\r\\ndeemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But\\r\\nwhile now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such\\r\\nliveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue some\\r\\nuncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For nothing was\\r\\nthis man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as\\r\\nit were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding\\r\\ninfinite of things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity\\r\\ndiscernible in the whole visible world; which while pauselessly active\\r\\nin uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you,\\r\\nthough you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible\\r\\nstolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying\\r\\nheartlessness;\\u2014yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an old,\\r\\ncrutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now\\r\\nand then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have served\\r\\nto pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle\\r\\nof Noah\\u2019s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a life-long\\r\\nwanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had gathered no moss;\\r\\nbut what is more, had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings\\r\\nmight have originally pertained to him? He was a stript abstract; an\\r\\nunfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born babe; living without\\r\\npremeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost\\r\\nsay, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of\\r\\nunintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so\\r\\nmuch by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to\\r\\nit, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by\\r\\na kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure\\r\\nmanipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early\\r\\noozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of\\r\\nthose unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo, Sheffield\\r\\ncontrivances, assuming the exterior\\u2014though a little swelled\\u2014of a\\r\\ncommon pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,\\r\\nbut also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,\\r\\nnail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the\\r\\ncarpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part\\r\\nof him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the\\r\\nlegs, and there they were.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,\\r\\nwas, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a\\r\\ncommon soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously\\r\\ndid its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few\\r\\ndrops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it\\r\\nhad abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same\\r\\nunaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept\\r\\nhim a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an unreasoning\\r\\nwheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his body was a\\r\\nsentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking all the\\r\\ntime to keep himself awake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 108. Ahab and the Carpenter. The Deck\\u2014First Night Watch.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two\\r\\nlanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is\\r\\nfirmly fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws,\\r\\nand various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red\\r\\nflame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work.)\\r\\n\\r\\nDrat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft,\\r\\nand that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and\\r\\nshinbones. Let\\u2019s try another. Aye, now, this works better (sneezes).\\r\\nHalloa, this bone dust is (sneezes)\\u2014why it\\u2019s (sneezes)\\u2014yes it\\u2019s\\r\\n(sneezes)\\u2014bless my soul, it won\\u2019t let me speak! This is what an old\\r\\nfellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you\\r\\ndon\\u2019t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don\\u2019t get it\\r\\n(sneezes). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let\\u2019s\\r\\nhave that ferule and buckle-screw; I\\u2019ll be ready for them presently.\\r\\nLucky now (sneezes) there\\u2019s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle a\\r\\nlittle; but a mere shinbone\\u2014why it\\u2019s easy as making hop-poles; only\\r\\nI should like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the\\r\\ntime, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (sneezes) scraped\\r\\nto a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs I\\u2019ve\\r\\nseen in shop windows wouldn\\u2019t compare at all. They soak water, they\\r\\ndo; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored (sneezes) with\\r\\nwashes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before I saw it off,\\r\\nnow, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the length will be\\r\\nall right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that\\u2019s the heel; we\\r\\nare in luck; here he comes, or it\\u2019s somebody else, that\\u2019s certain.\\r\\n\\r\\nAHAB (advancing). (During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues\\r\\nsneezing at times.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, manmaker!\\r\\n\\r\\nJust in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length.\\r\\nLet me measure, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeasured for a leg! good. Well, it\\u2019s not the first time. About it!\\r\\nThere; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here,\\r\\ncarpenter; let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, sir, it will break bones\\u2014beware, beware!\\r\\n\\r\\nNo fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery\\r\\nworld that can hold, man. What\\u2019s Prometheus about there?\\u2014the\\r\\nblacksmith, I mean\\u2014what\\u2019s he about?\\r\\n\\r\\nHe must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight. It\\u2019s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a\\r\\nfierce red flame there!\\r\\n\\r\\nAye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.\\r\\n\\r\\nUm-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that\\r\\nold Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a\\r\\nblacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what\\u2019s made in fire must\\r\\nproperly belong to fire; and so hell\\u2019s probable. How the soot flies!\\r\\nThis must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter,\\r\\nwhen he\\u2019s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel\\r\\nshoulder-blades; there\\u2019s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir?\\r\\n\\r\\nHold; while Prometheus is about it, I\\u2019ll order a complete man after a\\r\\ndesirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest\\r\\nmodelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to \\u2018em, to\\r\\nstay in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at\\r\\nall, brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and\\r\\nlet me see\\u2014shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light\\r\\non top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, what\\u2019s he speaking about, and who\\u2019s he speaking to, I should\\r\\nlike to know? Shall I keep standing here? (aside).\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u2018Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here\\u2019s one.\\r\\nNo, no, no; I must have a lantern.\\r\\n\\r\\nHo, ho! That\\u2019s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?\\r\\nThrusted light is worse than presented pistols.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.\\r\\n\\r\\nCarpenter? why that\\u2019s\\u2014but no;\\u2014a very tidy, and, I may say,\\r\\nan extremely gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here,\\r\\ncarpenter;\\u2014or would\\u2019st thou rather work in clay?\\r\\n\\r\\nSir?\\u2014Clay? clay, sir? That\\u2019s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fellow\\u2019s impious! What art thou sneezing about?\\r\\n\\r\\nBone is rather dusty, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nTake the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under\\r\\nliving people\\u2019s noses.\\r\\n\\r\\nSir?\\u2014oh! ah!\\u2014I guess so;\\u2014yes\\u2014dear!\\r\\n\\r\\nLook ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good\\r\\nworkmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well\\r\\nfor thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall\\r\\nnevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that\\r\\nis, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst\\r\\nthou not drive that old Adam away?\\r\\n\\r\\nTruly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard\\r\\nsomething curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never\\r\\nentirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still\\r\\npricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once\\r\\nwas; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the\\r\\nsoul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to a\\r\\nhair, do I. Is\\u2019t a riddle?\\r\\n\\r\\nI should humbly call it a poser, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nHist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing\\r\\nmay not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where\\r\\nthou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most\\r\\nsolitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don\\u2019t\\r\\nspeak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be now\\r\\nso long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the fiery\\r\\npains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!\\r\\n\\r\\nGood Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over again;\\r\\nI think I didn\\u2019t carry a small figure, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.\\u2014How long before\\r\\nthe leg is done?\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps an hour, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nBungle away at it then, and bring it to me (turns to go). Oh, Life! Here\\r\\nI am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for\\r\\na bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal inter-indebtedness which will\\r\\nnot do away with ledgers. I would be free as air; and I\\u2019m down in the\\r\\nwhole world\\u2019s books. I am so rich, I could have given bid for bid with\\r\\nthe wealthiest Praetorians at the auction of the Roman empire (which was\\r\\nthe world\\u2019s); and yet I owe for the flesh in the tongue I brag with.\\r\\nBy heavens! I\\u2019ll get a crucible, and into it, and dissolve myself down\\r\\nto one small, compendious vertebra. So.\\r\\n\\r\\nCARPENTER (resuming his work).\\r\\n\\r\\nWell, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says\\r\\nhe\\u2019s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;\\r\\nhe\\u2019s queer, says Stubb; he\\u2019s queer\\u2014queer, queer; and keeps dinning\\r\\nit into Mr. Starbuck all the time\\u2014queer\\u2014sir\\u2014queer, queer, very\\r\\nqueer. And here\\u2019s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here\\u2019s his\\r\\nbedfellow! has a stick of whale\\u2019s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his\\r\\nleg; he\\u2019ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in\\r\\nthree places, and all three places standing in one hell\\u2014how was\\r\\nthat? Oh! I don\\u2019t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I\\u2019m a sort of\\r\\nstrange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that\\u2019s only haphazard-like.\\r\\nThen, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade\\r\\nout into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water\\r\\nchucks you under the chin pretty quick, and there\\u2019s a great cry for\\r\\nlife-boats. And here\\u2019s the heron\\u2019s leg! long and slim, sure enough!\\r\\nNow, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be\\r\\nbecause they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her\\r\\nroly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he\\u2019s a hard driver. Look,\\r\\ndriven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears\\r\\nout bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there\\r\\nwith those screws, and let\\u2019s finish it before the resurrection\\r\\nfellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as\\r\\nbrewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill \\u2018em up\\r\\nagain. What a leg this is! It looks like a real live leg, filed down to\\r\\nnothing but the core; he\\u2019ll be standing on this to-morrow; he\\u2019ll be\\r\\ntaking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval slate,\\r\\nsmoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so; chisel, file,\\r\\nand sand-paper, now!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 109. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no\\r\\ninconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have\\r\\nsprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into\\r\\nthe cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*\\r\\n\\r\\n*In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it\\r\\nis a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench\\r\\nthe casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is\\r\\nremoved by the ship\\u2019s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought to be kept\\r\\ndamply tight; while by the changed character of the withdrawn water, the\\r\\nmariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and\\r\\nthe Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from\\r\\nthe China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with\\r\\na general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him;\\r\\nand another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the\\r\\nJapanese islands\\u2014Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new\\r\\nivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long\\r\\npruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with his\\r\\nback to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his old\\r\\ncourses again.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho\\u2019s there?\\u201d hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning\\r\\nround to it. \\u201cOn deck! Begone!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir.\\r\\nWe must up Burtons and break out.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cUp Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to\\r\\nhere for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEither do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make\\r\\ngood in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth\\r\\nsaving, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSo it is, so it is; if we get it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it\\r\\nleak! I\\u2019m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of\\r\\nleaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that\\u2019s a\\r\\nfar worse plight than the Pequod\\u2019s, man. Yet I don\\u2019t stop to plug my\\r\\nleak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug\\r\\nit, even if found, in this life\\u2019s howling gale? Starbuck! I\\u2019ll not\\r\\nhave the Burtons hoisted.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat will the owners say, sir?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLet the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons.\\r\\nWhat cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me,\\r\\nStarbuck, about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my\\r\\nconscience. But look ye, the only real owner of anything is its\\r\\ncommander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship\\u2019s keel.\\u2014On\\r\\ndeck!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCaptain Ahab,\\u201d said the reddening mate, moving further into the\\r\\ncabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it\\r\\nalmost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest\\r\\noutward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half\\r\\ndistrustful of itself; \\u201cA better man than I might well pass over in\\r\\nthee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in a\\r\\nhappier, Captain Ahab.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDevils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of\\r\\nme?\\u2014On deck!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir\\u2014to be\\r\\nforbearing! Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most\\r\\nSouth-Sea-men\\u2019s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,\\r\\nexclaimed: \\u201cThere is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one\\r\\nCaptain that is lord over the Pequod.\\u2014On deck!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,\\r\\nyou would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of\\r\\nthe levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and\\r\\nas he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: \\u201cThou hast\\r\\noutraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of\\r\\nStarbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of\\r\\nthyself, old man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!\\u201d\\r\\nmurmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that he said\\u2014Ahab\\r\\nbeware of Ahab\\u2014there\\u2019s something there!\\u201d Then unconsciously using\\r\\nthe musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the\\r\\nlittle cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed,\\r\\nand returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,\\u201d he said lowly to the\\r\\nmate; then raising his voice to the crew: \\u201cFurl the t\\u2019gallant-sails,\\r\\nand close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up\\r\\nBurton, and break out in the main-hold.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting\\r\\nStarbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him;\\r\\nor mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously\\r\\nforbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,\\r\\nin the important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders\\r\\nwere executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold\\r\\nwere perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it\\r\\nbeing calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the\\r\\nslumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight\\r\\nsending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they\\r\\ngo; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost\\r\\npuncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone cask\\r\\ncontaining coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted placards,\\r\\nvainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood. Tierce after\\r\\ntierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of staves, and\\r\\niron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the piled decks\\r\\nwere hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under foot, as if\\r\\nyou were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and rolled in the sea\\r\\nlike an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the ship as a dinnerless\\r\\nstudent with all Aristotle in his head. Well was it that the Typhoons\\r\\ndid not visit them then.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast\\r\\nbosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh\\r\\nto his endless end.\\r\\n\\r\\nBe it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;\\r\\ndignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the\\r\\nhigher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who,\\r\\nas harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale,\\r\\nbut\\u2014as we have elsewhere seen\\u2014mount his dead back in a rolling sea;\\r\\nand finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating\\r\\nall day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the\\r\\nclumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen,\\r\\nthe harpooneers are the holders, so called.\\r\\n\\r\\nPoor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should\\r\\nhave stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,\\r\\nstripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about\\r\\namid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom\\r\\nof a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor\\r\\npagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he\\r\\ncaught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after\\r\\nsome days\\u2019 suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very\\r\\nsill of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few\\r\\nlong-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his\\r\\nframe and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his cheek-bones\\r\\ngrew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller and fuller;\\r\\nthey became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but deeply\\r\\nlooked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony to that\\r\\nimmortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And like\\r\\ncircles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes\\r\\nseemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that\\r\\ncannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this\\r\\nwaning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who\\r\\nwere bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly wondrous and\\r\\nfearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing\\r\\nnear of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last\\r\\nrevelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell.\\r\\nSo that\\u2014let us say it again\\u2014no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher\\r\\nand holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping\\r\\nover the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying\\r\\nhammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final\\r\\nrest, and the ocean\\u2019s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and\\r\\nhigher towards his destined heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,\\r\\nwhat he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he\\r\\nasked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was\\r\\njust breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he\\r\\nhad chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich\\r\\nwar-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all\\r\\nwhalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,\\r\\nand that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was not\\r\\nunlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead warrior,\\r\\nstretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to\\r\\nthe starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the stars\\r\\nare isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own mild,\\r\\nuncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the\\r\\nwhite breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at\\r\\nthe thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual\\r\\nsea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.\\r\\nNo: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial\\r\\nto him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes\\r\\nwere without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and\\r\\nmuch lee-way adown the dim ages.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter\\r\\nwas at once commanded to do Queequeg\\u2019s bidding, whatever it might\\r\\ninclude. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,\\r\\nwhich, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal\\r\\ngroves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin\\r\\nwas recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of\\r\\nthe order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent\\r\\npromptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and\\r\\ntook Queequeg\\u2019s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking\\r\\nQueequeg\\u2019s person as he shifted the rule.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAh! poor fellow! he\\u2019ll have to die now,\\u201d ejaculated the Long\\r\\nIsland sailor.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general\\r\\nreference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin\\r\\nwas to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches\\r\\nat its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools,\\r\\nand to work.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted,\\r\\nhe lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring\\r\\nwhether they were ready for it yet in that direction.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people\\r\\non deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one\\u2019s\\r\\nconsternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to\\r\\nhim, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some\\r\\ndying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will\\r\\nshortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be\\r\\nindulged.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with\\r\\nan attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock\\r\\ndrawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along\\r\\nwith one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,\\r\\nbiscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water\\r\\nwas placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in\\r\\nthe hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a\\r\\npillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he\\r\\nmight make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving\\r\\na few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little\\r\\ngod, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he\\r\\ncalled for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him.\\r\\nThe head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg\\r\\nin his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view.\\r\\n\\u201cRarmai\\u201d (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and signed\\r\\nto be replaced in his hammock.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all this\\r\\nwhile, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took him\\r\\nby the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPoor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where\\r\\ngo ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where\\r\\nthe beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little\\r\\nerrand for me? Seek out one Pip, who\\u2019s now been missing long: I think\\r\\nhe\\u2019s in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he\\r\\nmust be very sad; for look! he\\u2019s left his tambourine behind;\\u2014I found\\r\\nit. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I\\u2019ll beat ye your\\r\\ndying march.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have heard,\\u201d murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, \\u201cthat\\r\\nin violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues;\\r\\nand that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their\\r\\nwholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken\\r\\nin their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor Pip,\\r\\nin this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers of all\\r\\nour heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?\\u2014Hark! he speaks\\r\\nagain: but more wildly now.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cForm two and two! Let\\u2019s make a General of him! Ho, where\\u2019s his\\r\\nharpoon? Lay it across here.\\u2014Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game\\r\\ncock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!\\u2014mind ye\\r\\nthat; Queequeg dies game!\\u2014take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies\\r\\ngame! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;\\r\\ndied all a\\u2019shiver;\\u2014out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all\\r\\nthe Antilles he\\u2019s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them\\r\\nhe jumped from a whale-boat! I\\u2019d never beat my tambourine over base\\r\\nPip, and hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no!\\r\\nshame upon all cowards\\u2014shame upon them! Let \\u2018em go drown like Pip,\\r\\nthat jumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip\\r\\nwas led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\\r\\nthat his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon\\r\\nthere seemed no need of the carpenter\\u2019s box: and thereupon, when some\\r\\nexpressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the\\r\\ncause of his sudden convalescence was this;\\u2014at a critical moment, he\\r\\nhad just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;\\r\\nand therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,\\r\\nhe averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of\\r\\nhis own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word,\\r\\nit was Queequeg\\u2019s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live,\\r\\nmere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or\\r\\nsome violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;\\r\\nthat while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,\\r\\ngenerally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.\\r\\nSo, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after\\r\\nsitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a\\r\\nvigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms\\r\\nand legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then\\r\\nspringing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,\\r\\npronounced himself fit for a fight.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and\\r\\nemptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.\\r\\nMany spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of\\r\\ngrotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was\\r\\nstriving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on\\r\\nhis body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and\\r\\nseer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written out on\\r\\nhis body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a mystical\\r\\ntreatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in his own\\r\\nproper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one volume; but\\r\\nwhose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own live heart\\r\\nbeat against them; and these mysteries were therefore destined in\\r\\nthe end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were\\r\\ninscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought it must\\r\\nhave been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his, when\\r\\none morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg\\u2014\\u201cOh, devilish\\r\\ntantalization of the gods!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 111. The Pacific.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great South\\r\\nSea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear Pacific\\r\\nwith uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my youth was\\r\\nanswered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues\\r\\nof blue.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently\\r\\nawful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those\\r\\nfabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.\\r\\nJohn. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery\\r\\nprairies and Potters\\u2019 Fields of all four continents, the waves should\\r\\nrise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of mixed\\r\\nshades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all that\\r\\nwe call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing like\\r\\nslumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by their\\r\\nrestlessness.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must\\r\\never after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of\\r\\nthe world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same\\r\\nwaves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday\\r\\nplanted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still\\r\\ngorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between\\r\\nfloat milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown\\r\\nArchipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine\\r\\nPacific zones the world\\u2019s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay\\r\\nto it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal\\r\\nswells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab\\u2019s brain, as standing like an\\r\\niron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one\\r\\nnostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles\\r\\n(in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other\\r\\nconsciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in\\r\\nwhich the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at\\r\\nlength upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese\\r\\ncruising-ground, the old man\\u2019s purpose intensified itself. His firm\\r\\nlips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead\\u2019s veins\\r\\nswelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran\\r\\nthrough the vaulted hull, \\u201cStern all! the White Whale spouts thick\\r\\nblood!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.\\r\\n\\r\\nAvailing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in\\r\\nthese latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active\\r\\npursuits shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old\\r\\nblacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after\\r\\nconcluding his contributory work for Ahab\\u2019s leg, but still retained\\r\\nit on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost\\r\\nincessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do\\r\\nsome little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their\\r\\nvarious weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an\\r\\neager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads,\\r\\nharpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every sooty movement,\\r\\nas he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man\\u2019s was a patient hammer\\r\\nwielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no petulance did\\r\\ncome from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further his\\r\\nchronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself,\\r\\nand the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart. And\\r\\nso it was.\\u2014Most miserable!\\r\\n\\r\\nA peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing\\r\\nyawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the\\r\\ncuriosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted\\r\\nquestionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every\\r\\none now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelated, and not innocently, one bitter winter\\u2019s midnight, on the road\\r\\nrunning between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt\\r\\nthe deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,\\r\\ndilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both\\r\\nfeet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four\\r\\nacts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied fifth\\r\\nact of the grief of his life\\u2019s drama.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly\\r\\nencountered that thing in sorrow\\u2019s technicals called ruin. He had been\\r\\nan artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house\\r\\nand garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three\\r\\nblithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,\\r\\nplanted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further\\r\\nconcealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into\\r\\nhis happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to\\r\\ntell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into\\r\\nhis family\\u2019s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of\\r\\nthat fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,\\r\\nfor prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith\\u2019s shop\\r\\nwas in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it;\\r\\nso that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no\\r\\nunhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing of\\r\\nher young-armed old husband\\u2019s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled by\\r\\npassing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly, in\\r\\nher nursery; and so, to stout Labor\\u2019s iron lullaby, the blacksmith\\u2019s\\r\\ninfants were rocked to slumber.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely? Hadst\\r\\nthou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon\\r\\nhim, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her orphans a\\r\\ntruly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after years; and\\r\\nall of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked down some\\r\\nvirtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the\\r\\nresponsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than useless\\r\\nold man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to\\r\\nharvest.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhy tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew more\\r\\nand more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the last;\\r\\nthe wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes, glitteringly\\r\\ngazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows fell; the\\r\\nforge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother dived\\r\\ndown into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed her\\r\\nthither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a vagabond\\r\\nin crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to flaxen\\r\\ncurls!\\r\\n\\r\\nDeath seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death\\r\\nis only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but\\r\\nthe first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the\\r\\nWild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of\\r\\nsuch men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions against\\r\\nsuicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean alluringly\\r\\nspread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking terrors, and\\r\\nwonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of infinite\\r\\nPacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them\\u2014\\u201cCome hither,\\r\\nbroken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate\\r\\ndeath; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come\\r\\nhither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and\\r\\nabhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put\\r\\nup thy gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till we\\r\\nmarry thee!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by fall\\r\\nof eve, the blacksmith\\u2019s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth\\r\\nwent a-whaling.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 113. The Forge.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about\\r\\nmid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter\\r\\nplaced upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the\\r\\ncoals, and with the other at his forge\\u2019s lungs, when Captain Ahab came\\r\\nalong, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While\\r\\nyet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,\\r\\nPerth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the\\r\\nanvil\\u2014the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,\\r\\nsome of which flew close to Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAre these thy Mother Carey\\u2019s chickens, Perth? they are always\\r\\nflying in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;\\u2014look\\r\\nhere, they burn; but thou\\u2014thou liv\\u2019st among them without a\\r\\nscorch.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBecause I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,\\u201d answered Perth,\\r\\nresting for a moment on his hammer; \\u201cI am past scorching; not easily\\r\\ncan\\u2019st thou scorch a scar.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely\\r\\nwoeful to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in\\r\\nothers that is not mad. Thou should\\u2019st go mad, blacksmith; say, why\\r\\ndost thou not go mad? How can\\u2019st thou endure without being mad? Do the\\r\\nheavens yet hate thee, that thou can\\u2019st not go mad?\\u2014What wert thou\\r\\nmaking there?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWelding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd can\\u2019st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such\\r\\nhard usage as it had?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI think so, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd I suppose thou can\\u2019st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never\\r\\nmind how hard the metal, blacksmith?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook ye here, then,\\u201d cried Ahab, passionately advancing,\\r\\nand leaning with both hands on Perth\\u2019s shoulders; \\u201clook ye\\r\\nhere\\u2014here\\u2014can ye smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,\\u201d\\r\\nsweeping one hand across his ribbed brow; \\u201cif thou could\\u2019st,\\r\\nblacksmith, glad enough would I lay my head upon thy anvil, and feel\\r\\nthy heaviest hammer between my eyes. Answer! Can\\u2019st thou smoothe this\\r\\nseam?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for\\r\\nthough thou only see\\u2019st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into\\r\\nthe bone of my skull\\u2014that is all wrinkles! But, away with child\\u2019s\\r\\nplay; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!\\u201d jingling the\\r\\nleathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. \\u201cI, too, want a\\r\\nharpoon made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;\\r\\nsomething that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There\\u2019s\\r\\nthe stuff,\\u201d flinging the pouch upon the anvil. \\u201cLook ye, blacksmith,\\r\\nthese are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing\\r\\nhorses.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHorse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the\\r\\nbest and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from\\r\\nthe melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me\\r\\nfirst, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these\\r\\ntwelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I\\u2019ll\\r\\nblow the fire.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by\\r\\nspiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. \\u201cA\\r\\nflaw!\\u201d rejecting the last one. \\u201cWork that over again, Perth.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThis done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when\\r\\nAhab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,\\r\\nwith regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to\\r\\nhim the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge\\r\\nshooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and\\r\\nbowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or\\r\\nsome blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?\\u201d muttered\\r\\nStubb, looking on from the forecastle. \\u201cThat Parsee smells fire like a\\r\\nfusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket\\u2019s powder-pan.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as\\r\\nPerth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near\\r\\nby, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab\\u2019s bent face.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWould\\u2019st thou brand me, Perth?\\u201d wincing for a moment with the\\r\\npain; \\u201chave I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this\\r\\nharpoon for the White Whale?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFor the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them\\r\\nthyself, man. Here are my razors\\u2014the best of steel; here, and make the\\r\\nbarbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain\\r\\nnot use them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTake them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave,\\r\\nsup, nor pray till\\u2014but here\\u2014to work!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the\\r\\nshank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith\\r\\nwas about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he\\r\\ncried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, no\\u2014no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,\\r\\nthere! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me\\r\\nas much blood as will cover this barb?\\u201d holding it high up. A cluster\\r\\nof dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen\\r\\nflesh, and the White Whale\\u2019s barbs were then tempered.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEgo non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!\\u201d\\r\\ndeliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the\\r\\nbaptismal blood.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of hickory,\\r\\nwith the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the socket of\\r\\nthe iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of\\r\\nit taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing\\r\\nhis foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string, then eagerly\\r\\nbending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed, \\u201cGood! and\\r\\nnow for the seizings.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns\\r\\nwere all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole\\r\\nwas then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope was\\r\\ntraced half-way along the pole\\u2019s length, and firmly secured so, with\\r\\nintertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope\\u2014like the\\r\\nThree Fates\\u2014remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with\\r\\nthe weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory\\r\\npole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his\\r\\ncabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was\\r\\nheard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy\\r\\nstrange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the\\r\\nmelancholy ship, and mocked it!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 114. The Gilder.\\r\\n\\r\\nPenetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising\\r\\nground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,\\r\\npleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on the\\r\\nstretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or sailing,\\r\\nor paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or seventy\\r\\nminutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small success\\r\\nfor their pains.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow\\r\\nheaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so\\r\\nsociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone\\r\\ncats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy\\r\\nquietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the\\r\\nocean\\u2019s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it;\\r\\nand would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a\\r\\nremorseless fang.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a\\r\\ncertain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he\\r\\nregards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing\\r\\nonly the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high\\r\\nrolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when\\r\\nthe western emigrants\\u2019 horses only show their erected ears, while\\r\\ntheir hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these\\r\\nthere steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied\\r\\nchildren lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when\\r\\nthe flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most\\r\\nmystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,\\r\\nand form one seamless whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as\\r\\ntemporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem\\r\\nto open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath upon\\r\\nthem prove but tarnishing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in\\r\\nye,\\u2014though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,\\u2014in\\r\\nye, men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for\\r\\nsome few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on\\r\\nthem. Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled,\\r\\nmingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by\\r\\nstorms, a storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress\\r\\nin this life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the\\r\\nlast one pause:\\u2014through infancy\\u2019s unconscious spell, boyhood\\u2019s\\r\\nthoughtless faith, adolescence\\u2019 doubt (the common doom), then\\r\\nscepticism, then disbelief, resting at last in manhood\\u2019s pondering\\r\\nrepose of If. But once gone through, we trace the round again; and are\\r\\ninfants, boys, and men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor,\\r\\nwhence we unmoor no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which\\r\\nthe weariest will never weary? Where is the foundling\\u2019s father hidden?\\r\\nOur souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing\\r\\nthem: the secret of our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there\\r\\nto learn it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat\\u2019s side into that\\r\\nsame golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLoveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride\\u2019s\\r\\neye!\\u2014Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping\\r\\ncannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep\\r\\ndown and do believe.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same\\r\\ngolden light:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths\\r\\nthat he has always been jolly!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down\\r\\nbefore the wind, some few weeks after Ahab\\u2019s harpoon had been welded.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her\\r\\nlast cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in glad\\r\\nholiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously, sailing\\r\\nround among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous to\\r\\npointing her prow for home.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red bunting\\r\\nat their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down;\\r\\nand hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the\\r\\nlast whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colours\\r\\nwere flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways lashed in each of\\r\\nher three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her\\r\\ntop-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious\\r\\nfluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most surprising\\r\\nsuccess; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in the same\\r\\nseas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a\\r\\nsingle fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to\\r\\nmake room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional supplemental\\r\\ncasks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met; and these\\r\\nwere stowed along the deck, and in the captain\\u2019s and officers\\u2019\\r\\nstate-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked into\\r\\nkindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an\\r\\noil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the forecastle,\\r\\nthe sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests, and filled\\r\\nthem; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a head on his\\r\\nlargest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged his spare\\r\\ncoffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the sockets\\r\\nof their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was filled with\\r\\nsperm, except the captain\\u2019s pantaloons pockets, and those he reserved\\r\\nto thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of his entire\\r\\nsatisfaction.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the\\r\\nbarbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing\\r\\nstill nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge\\r\\ntry-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like poke or stomach skin of\\r\\nthe black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched\\r\\nhands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and harpooneers were\\r\\ndancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with them from the\\r\\nPolynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat, firmly secured\\r\\naloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long Island negroes, with\\r\\nglittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were presiding over the hilarious\\r\\njig. Meanwhile, others of the ship\\u2019s company were tumultuously busy at\\r\\nthe masonry of the try-works, from which the huge pots had been\\r\\nremoved. You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed\\r\\nBastille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and\\r\\nmortar were being hurled into the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the\\r\\nship\\u2019s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was\\r\\nfull before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual\\r\\ndiversion.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,\\r\\nwith a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other\\u2019s\\r\\nwakes\\u2014one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings\\r\\nas to things to come\\u2014their two captains in themselves impersonated the\\r\\nwhole striking contrast of the scene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCome aboard, come aboard!\\u201d cried the gay Bachelor\\u2019s commander,\\r\\nlifting a glass and a bottle in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\\u201d gritted Ahab in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo; only heard of him; but don\\u2019t believe in him at all,\\u201d said the\\r\\nother good-humoredly. \\u201cCome aboard!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNot enough to speak of\\u2014two islanders, that\\u2019s all;\\u2014but come\\r\\naboard, old hearty, come along. I\\u2019ll soon take that black from\\r\\nyour brow. Come along, will ye (merry\\u2019s the play); a full ship and\\r\\nhomeward-bound.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow wondrous familiar is a fool!\\u201d muttered Ahab; then aloud,\\r\\n\\u201cThou art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call\\r\\nme an empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine.\\r\\nForward there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other\\r\\nstubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew\\r\\nof the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding\\r\\nBachelor; but the Bachelor\\u2019s men never heeding their gaze for the\\r\\nlively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail,\\r\\neyed the homewardbound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial\\r\\nof sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby\\r\\nbringing two remote associations together, for that vial was filled with\\r\\nNantucket soundings.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune\\u2019s favourites\\r\\nsail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the\\r\\nrushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed\\r\\nit with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,\\r\\nwhales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson\\r\\nfight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun\\r\\nand whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such\\r\\nplaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that\\r\\nit almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of\\r\\nthe Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had\\r\\ngone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned\\r\\noff from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the now\\r\\ntranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales\\r\\ndying\\u2014the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring\\u2014that strange\\r\\nspectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab conveyed a\\r\\nwondrousness unknown before.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe turns and turns him to it,\\u2014how slowly, but how steadfastly, his\\r\\nhomage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too\\r\\nworships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!\\u2014Oh\\r\\nthat these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.\\r\\nLook! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe;\\r\\nin these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks\\r\\nfurnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still\\r\\nrolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the\\r\\nNiger\\u2019s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;\\r\\nbut see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it\\r\\nheads some other way.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast\\r\\nbuilded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured\\r\\nseas; thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in\\r\\nthe wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm.\\r\\nNor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone\\r\\nround again, without a lesson to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring,\\r\\nrainbowed jet!\\u2014that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In\\r\\nvain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening\\r\\nsun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost\\r\\nthou, darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy\\r\\nunnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of\\r\\nonce living things, exhaled as air, but water now.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild\\r\\nfowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though\\r\\nhill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to\\r\\nwindward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These\\r\\nlast three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one\\r\\ncould not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay\\r\\nby its side all night; and that boat was Ahab\\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale\\u2019s spout-hole; and\\r\\nthe lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare\\r\\nupon the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which\\r\\ngently chafed the whale\\u2019s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab and all his boat\\u2019s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who\\r\\ncrouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played\\r\\nround the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails.\\r\\nA sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven\\r\\nghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarted from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and\\r\\nhooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a\\r\\nflooded world. \\u201cI have dreamed it again,\\u201d said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOf the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor\\r\\ncoffin can be thine?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd who are hearsed that die on the sea?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two\\r\\nhearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by\\r\\nmortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in\\r\\nAmerica.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:\\u2014a hearse and its plumes\\r\\nfloating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a\\r\\nsight we shall not soon see.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBelieve it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd what was that saying about thyself?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThough it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy\\r\\npilot.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd when thou art so gone before\\u2014if that ever befall\\u2014then ere I\\r\\ncan follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?\\u2014Was it\\r\\nnot so? Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here\\r\\ntwo pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTake another pledge, old man,\\u201d said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted\\r\\nup like fire-flies in the gloom\\u2014\\u201cHemp only can kill thee.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe gallows, ye mean.\\u2014I am immortal then, on land and on sea,\\u201d\\r\\ncried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;\\u2014\\u201cImmortal on land and on\\r\\nsea!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the\\r\\nslumbering crew arose from the boat\\u2019s bottom, and ere noon the dead\\r\\nwhale was brought to the ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,\\r\\ncoming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would\\r\\nostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to\\r\\nthe braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on\\r\\nthe nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship\\u2019s prow\\r\\nfor the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon high\\r\\nnoon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was\\r\\nabout taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his\\r\\nlatitude.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of\\r\\neffulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing\\r\\nfocus of the glassy ocean\\u2019s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks\\r\\nlacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this nakedness\\r\\nof unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of God\\u2019s\\r\\nthrone. Well that Ahab\\u2019s quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses,\\r\\nthrough which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging his\\r\\nseated form to the roll of the ship, and with his astrological-looking\\r\\ninstrument placed to his eye, he remained in that posture for some\\r\\nmoments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its\\r\\nprecise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention was absorbed, the\\r\\nParsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship\\u2019s deck, and with face\\r\\nthrown up like Ahab\\u2019s, was eyeing the same sun with him; only the lids\\r\\nof his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was subdued to an\\r\\nearthly passionlessness. At length the desired observation was taken;\\r\\nand with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab soon calculated what his\\r\\nlatitude must be at that precise instant. Then falling into a moment\\u2019s\\r\\nrevery, he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself:\\r\\n\\u201cThou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou tellest me truly\\r\\nwhere I am\\u2014but canst thou cast the least hint where I shall be? Or\\r\\ncanst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living?\\r\\nWhere is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be eyeing him. These eyes\\r\\nof mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him; aye,\\r\\nand into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the\\r\\nunknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its\\r\\nnumerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:\\r\\n\\u201cFoolish toy! babies\\u2019 plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,\\r\\nand Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but\\r\\nwhat after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where\\r\\nthou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that\\r\\nholds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop\\r\\nof water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy\\r\\nimpotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;\\r\\nand cursed be all the things that cast man\\u2019s eyes aloft to that\\r\\nheaven, whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes\\r\\nare even now scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this\\r\\nearth\\u2019s horizon are the glances of man\\u2019s eyes; not shot from the\\r\\ncrown of his head, as if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament.\\r\\nCurse thee, thou quadrant!\\u201d dashing it to the deck, \\u201cno longer will\\r\\nI guide my earthly way by thee; the level ship\\u2019s compass, and the\\r\\nlevel deadreckoning, by log and by line; these shall conduct me, and\\r\\nshow me my place on the sea. Aye,\\u201d lighting from the boat to the deck,\\r\\n\\u201cthus I trample on thee, thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on\\r\\nhigh; thus I split and destroy thee!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live\\r\\nand dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a\\r\\nfatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself\\u2014these passed over the\\r\\nmute, motionless Parsee\\u2019s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;\\r\\nwhile, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered\\r\\ntogether on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,\\r\\nshouted out\\u2014\\u201cTo the braces! Up helm!\\u2014square in!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon\\r\\nher heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon\\r\\nher long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one\\r\\nsufficient steed.\\r\\n\\r\\nStanding between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\ntumultuous way, and Ahab\\u2019s also, as he went lurching along the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full\\r\\nof its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,\\r\\ndown, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of\\r\\nthine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye,\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201cbut sea-coal ashes\\u2014mind ye that, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck\\u2014sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab\\r\\nmutter, \\u2018Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of\\r\\nmine; swears that I must play them, and no others.\\u2019 And damn me, Ahab,\\r\\nbut thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 119. The Candles.\\r\\n\\r\\nWarmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal\\r\\ncrouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most effulgent\\r\\nbut basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows tornadoes\\r\\nthat never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in these\\r\\nresplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all\\r\\nstorms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that cloudless\\r\\nsky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and\\r\\nbare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly\\r\\nahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the\\r\\nthunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts\\r\\nfluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the\\r\\ntempest had left for its after sport.\\r\\n\\r\\nHolding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at every\\r\\nflash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional disaster\\r\\nmight have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb and Flask\\r\\nwere directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the\\r\\nboats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted to the very top\\r\\nof the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab\\u2019s) did not escape. A\\r\\ngreat rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling ship\\u2019s high\\r\\nteetering side, stove in the boat\\u2019s bottom at the stern, and left it\\r\\nagain, all dripping through like a sieve.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,\\u201d said Stubb, regarding the wreck,\\r\\n\\u201cbut the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can\\u2019t fight it. You\\r\\nsee, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,\\r\\nall round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,\\r\\nall the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But never\\r\\nmind; it\\u2019s all in fun: so the old song says;\\u201d\\u2014(sings.)\\r\\n\\r\\n  Oh! jolly is the gale,\\r\\n  And a joker is the whale,\\r\\n  A\\u2019 flourishin\\u2019 his tail,\\u2014\\r\\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\r\\n\\r\\n  The scud all a flyin\\u2019,\\r\\n  That\\u2019s his flip only foamin\\u2019;\\r\\n  When he stirs in the spicin\\u2019,\\u2014\\r\\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\r\\n\\r\\n  Thunder splits the ships,\\r\\n  But he only smacks his lips,\\r\\n  A tastin\\u2019 of this flip,\\u2014\\r\\n  Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the Ocean, oh!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast Stubb,\\u201d cried Starbuck, \\u201clet the Typhoon sing, and strike\\r\\nhis harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold\\r\\nthy peace.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a\\r\\ncoward; and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck, there\\u2019s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut\\r\\nmy throat. And when that\\u2019s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for\\r\\na wind-up.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMadman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never\\r\\nmind how foolish?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHere!\\u201d cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing\\r\\nhis hand towards the weather bow, \\u201cmarkest thou not that the gale\\r\\ncomes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick?\\r\\nthe very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there;\\r\\nwhere is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to\\r\\nstand\\u2014his stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing\\r\\naway, if thou must!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t half understand ye: what\\u2019s in the wind?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to\\r\\nNantucket,\\u201d soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb\\u2019s\\r\\nquestion. \\u201cThe gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it\\r\\ninto a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,\\r\\nall is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward\\u2014I see it lightens\\r\\nup there; but not with the lightning.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following\\r\\nthe flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same\\r\\ninstant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWho\\u2019s there?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOld Thunder!\\u201d said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his\\r\\npivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed\\r\\nlances of fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off\\r\\nthe perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some\\r\\nships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But\\r\\nas this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may\\r\\navoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly\\r\\ntowing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering\\r\\nnot a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the\\r\\nvessel\\u2019s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a\\r\\nship\\u2019s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made\\r\\nin long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the\\r\\nchains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe rods! the rods!\\u201d cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly\\r\\nadmonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been\\r\\ndarting flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. \\u201cAre they overboard?\\r\\ndrop them over, fore and aft. Quick!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast!\\u201d cried Ahab; \\u201clet\\u2019s have fair play here, though we be\\r\\nthe weaker side. Yet I\\u2019ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs\\r\\nand Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let\\r\\nthem be, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook aloft!\\u201d cried Starbuck. \\u201cThe corpusants! the corpusants!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each\\r\\ntri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of\\r\\nthe three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like\\r\\nthree gigantic wax tapers before an altar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBlast the boat! let it go!\\u201d cried Stubb at this instant, as a\\r\\nswashing sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale\\r\\nviolently jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. \\u201cBlast\\r\\nit!\\u201d\\u2014but slipping backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the\\r\\nflames; and immediately shifting his tone he cried\\u2014\\u201cThe corpusants\\r\\nhave mercy on us all!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTo sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of\\r\\nthe calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses\\r\\nfrom the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething\\r\\nsea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when\\r\\nGod\\u2019s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His \\u201cMene,\\r\\nMene, Tekel Upharsin\\u201d has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the\\r\\nenchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle,\\r\\nall their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away\\r\\nconstellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the gigantic\\r\\njet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and seemed\\r\\nthe black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted mouth of\\r\\nTashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely gleamed as\\r\\nif they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by the\\r\\npreternatural light, Queequeg\\u2019s tattooing burned like Satanic blue\\r\\nflames on his body.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more\\r\\nthe Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment\\r\\nor two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It\\r\\nwas Stubb. \\u201cWhat thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not\\r\\nthe same in the song.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, no, it wasn\\u2019t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all;\\r\\nand I hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on\\r\\nlong faces?\\u2014have they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr.\\r\\nStarbuck\\u2014but it\\u2019s too dark to look. Hear me, then: I take that\\r\\nmast-head flame we saw for a sign of good luck; for those masts are\\r\\nrooted in a hold that is going to be chock a\\u2019 block with sperm-oil,\\r\\nd\\u2019ye see; and so, all that sperm will work up into the masts, like\\r\\nsap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti\\r\\ncandles\\u2014that\\u2019s the good promise we saw.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb\\u2019s face slowly beginning\\r\\nto glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: \\u201cSee! see!\\u201d\\r\\nand once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed\\r\\nredoubled supernaturalness in their pallor.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe corpusants have mercy on us all,\\u201d cried Stubb, again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,\\r\\nthe Parsee was kneeling in Ahab\\u2019s front, but with his head bowed away\\r\\nfrom him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where\\r\\nthey had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\\r\\narrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\\r\\nknot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various enchanted\\r\\nattitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in\\r\\nHerculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all their eyes\\r\\nupcast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye, men!\\u201d cried Ahab. \\u201cLook up at it; mark it well;\\r\\nthe white flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those\\r\\nmainmast links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat\\r\\nagainst it; blood against fire! So.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThen turning\\u2014the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot\\r\\nupon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm, he\\r\\nstood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian\\r\\nonce did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that to\\r\\nthis hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I now\\r\\nknow that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor reverence\\r\\nwilt thou be kind; and e\\u2019en for hate thou canst but kill; and all\\r\\nare killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,\\r\\nplaceless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will\\r\\ndispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of the\\r\\npersonified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a point\\r\\nat best; whencesoe\\u2019er I came; wheresoe\\u2019er I go; yet while I earthly\\r\\nlive, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal rights.\\r\\nBut war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of love, and\\r\\nI will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere supernal\\r\\npower; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted worlds,\\r\\nthere\\u2019s that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou clear\\r\\nspirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of fire, I\\r\\nbreathe it back to thee.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n[Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap lengthwise\\r\\nto thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes his eyes,\\r\\nhis right hand pressed hard upon them.]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it\\r\\nwrung from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I\\r\\ncan then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the\\r\\nhomage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The\\r\\nlightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my\\r\\nwhole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning\\r\\nground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though\\r\\nthou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of\\r\\nlight, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or\\r\\nnot? There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my\\r\\ngenealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know\\r\\nnot. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but\\r\\nthine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself\\r\\nunbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself\\r\\nunbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou\\r\\nomnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear\\r\\nspirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness\\r\\nmechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly\\r\\nsee it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast\\r\\nthy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with\\r\\nhaughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap\\r\\nwith thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly I\\r\\nworship thee!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe boat! the boat!\\u201d cried Starbuck, \\u201clook at thy boat, old\\r\\nman!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s harpoon, the one forged at Perth\\u2019s fire, remained firmly\\r\\nlashed in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his\\r\\nwhale-boat\\u2019s bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the\\r\\nloose leather sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now\\r\\ncame a levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon\\r\\nburned there like a serpent\\u2019s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the\\r\\narm\\u2014\\u201cGod, God is against thee, old man; forbear! \\u2018tis an ill\\r\\nvoyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may,\\r\\nold man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage\\r\\nthan this.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOverhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the\\r\\nbraces\\u2014though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast\\r\\nmate\\u2019s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But\\r\\ndashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the\\r\\nburning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to\\r\\ntransfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope\\u2019s end.\\r\\nPetrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart\\r\\nthat he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAll your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and\\r\\nheart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye\\r\\nmay know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out\\r\\nthe last fear!\\u201d And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the\\r\\nflame.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of\\r\\nsome lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it so\\r\\nmuch the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts;\\r\\nso at those last words of Ahab\\u2019s many of the mariners did run from him\\r\\nin a terror of dismay.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 120. The Deck Towards the End of the First Night Watch. Ahab\\r\\nstanding by the helm. Starbuck approaching him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWe must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working\\r\\nloose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStrike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I\\u2019d sway them up\\r\\nnow.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSir!\\u2014in God\\u2019s name!\\u2014sir?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStrike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind\\r\\nrises, but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to\\r\\nit.\\u2014By masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of\\r\\nsome coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots!\\r\\nLoftiest trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of\\r\\nmine now sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but\\r\\ncowards send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh\\r\\naloft there! I would e\\u2019en take it for sublime, did I not know that the\\r\\ncolic is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 121. Midnight.\\u2014The Forecastle Bulwarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over\\r\\nthe anchors there hanging.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but\\r\\nyou will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long\\r\\nago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn\\u2019t you once say that\\r\\nwhatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its\\r\\ninsurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft\\r\\nand boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn\\u2019t you say so?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell, suppose I did? What then? I\\u2019ve part changed my flesh since\\r\\nthat time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we are loaded with powder\\r\\nbarrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get\\r\\nafire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty\\r\\nred hair, but you couldn\\u2019t get afire now. Shake yourself; you\\u2019re\\r\\nAquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat\\r\\ncollar. Don\\u2019t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine\\r\\nInsurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask. But\\r\\nhark, again, and I\\u2019ll answer ye the other thing. First take your leg\\r\\noff from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the rope;\\r\\nnow listen. What\\u2019s the mighty difference between holding a mast\\u2019s\\r\\nlightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that\\r\\nhasn\\u2019t got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don\\u2019t you see, you\\r\\ntimber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the\\r\\nmast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in\\r\\na hundred carries rods, and Ahab,\\u2014aye, man, and all of us,\\u2014were\\r\\nin no more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten\\r\\nthousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I\\r\\nsuppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small\\r\\nlightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia\\r\\nofficer\\u2019s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why\\r\\ndon\\u2019t ye be sensible, Flask? it\\u2019s easy to be sensible; why don\\u2019t\\r\\nye, then? any man with half an eye can be sensible.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI don\\u2019t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYes, when a fellow\\u2019s soaked through, it\\u2019s hard to be sensible,\\r\\nthat\\u2019s a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind;\\r\\ncatch the turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these\\r\\nanchors now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these\\r\\ntwo anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man\\u2019s hands behind him.\\r\\nAnd what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron\\r\\nfists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the\\r\\nworld is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long\\r\\ncable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we\\u2019ve done. So; next\\r\\nto touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say, just\\r\\nwring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at long-togs\\r\\nso, Flask; but seems to me, a Long tailed coat ought always to be worn\\r\\nin all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way, serve to\\r\\ncarry off the water, d\\u2019ye see. Same with cocked hats; the cocks form\\r\\ngable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and tarpaulins for\\r\\nme; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a beaver; so. Halloa!\\r\\nwhew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord, Lord, that the winds that\\r\\ncome from heaven should be so unmannerly! This is a nasty night, lad.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 122.

Plenty too much thunder up here.\\r\\nWhat\\u2019s the use of thunder? Um, um, um. We don\\u2019t want thunder; we\\r\\nwant rum; give us a glass of rum. Um, um, um!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 123. The Musket.\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\njaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by\\r\\nits spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached\\r\\nto it\\u2014for they were slack\\u2014because some play to the tiller was\\r\\nindispensable.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock\\r\\nto the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the\\r\\ncompasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the\\r\\nPequod\\u2019s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice\\r\\nthe whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is\\r\\na sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted\\r\\nemotion.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the\\r\\nstrenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb\\u2014one engaged forward and the\\r\\nother aft\\u2014the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails\\r\\nwere cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like\\r\\nthe feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds when\\r\\nthat storm-tossed bird is on the wing.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a\\r\\nstorm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through\\r\\nthe water with some precision again; and the course\\u2014for the present,\\r\\nEast-south-east\\u2014which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more\\r\\ngiven to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only\\r\\nsteered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the\\r\\nship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile, lo!\\r\\na good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul breeze\\r\\nbecame fair!\\r\\n\\r\\nInstantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of \\u201cHo! the\\r\\nfair wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!\\u201d the crew singing for joy, that\\r\\nso promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents\\r\\npreceding it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn compliance with the standing order of his commander\\u2014to report\\r\\nimmediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided change\\r\\nin the affairs of the deck,\\u2014Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards\\r\\nto the breeze\\u2014however reluctantly and gloomily,\\u2014than he mechanically\\r\\nwent below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.\\r\\n\\r\\nEre knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a\\r\\nmoment. The cabin lamp\\u2014taking long swings this way and that\\u2014was\\r\\nburning fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man\\u2019s\\r\\nbolted door,\\u2014a thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of\\r\\nupper panels. The isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain\\r\\nhumming silence to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the\\r\\nroar of the elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly\\r\\nrevealed, as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck\\r\\nwas an honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck\\u2019s heart, at that\\r\\ninstant when he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil\\r\\nthought; but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for\\r\\nthe instant he hardly knew it for itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe would have shot me once,\\u201d he murmured, \\u201cyes, there\\u2019s the\\r\\nvery musket that he pointed at me;\\u2014that one with the studded stock;\\r\\nlet me touch it\\u2014lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many\\r\\ndeadly lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must\\r\\nsee. Aye, aye; and powder in the pan;\\u2014that\\u2019s not good. Best spill\\r\\nit?\\u2014wait. I\\u2019ll cure myself of this. I\\u2019ll hold the musket boldly\\r\\nwhile I think.\\u2014I come to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair\\r\\nfor death and doom,\\u2014that\\u2019s fair for Moby Dick. It\\u2019s a fair wind\\r\\nthat\\u2019s only fair for that accursed fish.\\u2014The very tube he pointed at\\r\\nme!\\u2014the very one; this one\\u2014I hold it here; he would have killed me\\r\\nwith the very thing I handle now.\\u2014Aye and he would fain kill all his\\r\\ncrew. Does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has\\r\\nhe not dashed his heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas,\\r\\ngropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding\\r\\nlog? and in this very Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no\\r\\nlightning-rods? But shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag\\r\\na whole ship\\u2019s company down to doom with him?\\u2014Yes, it would make\\r\\nhim the wilful murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any\\r\\ndeadly harm; and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will,\\r\\nif Ahab have his way. If, then, he were this instant\\u2014put aside, that\\r\\ncrime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just\\r\\nthere,\\u2014in there, he\\u2019s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive,\\r\\nand soon awake again. I can\\u2019t withstand thee, then, old man. Not\\r\\nreasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this\\r\\nthou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou\\r\\nbreathest. Aye, and say\\u2019st the men have vow\\u2019d thy vow; say\\u2019st\\r\\nall of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!\\u2014But is there no other way? no\\r\\nlawful way?\\u2014Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest\\r\\nthis old man\\u2019s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool\\r\\nwould try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes\\r\\nand hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would\\r\\nbe more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the\\r\\nsight; could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself,\\r\\ninestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage. What,\\r\\nthen, remains? The land is hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan\\r\\nthe nearest. I stand alone here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a\\r\\nwhole continent between me and law.\\u2014Aye, aye, \\u2018tis so.\\u2014Is heaven\\r\\na murderer when its lightning strikes a would-be murderer in his bed,\\r\\ntindering sheets and skin together?\\u2014And would I be a murderer, then,\\r\\nif\\u201d\\u2014and slowly, stealthily, and half sideways looking, he placed the\\r\\nloaded musket\\u2019s end against the door.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOn this level, Ahab\\u2019s hammock swings within; his head this way. A\\r\\ntouch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.\\u2014Oh\\r\\nMary! Mary!\\u2014boy! boy! boy!\\u2014But if I wake thee not to death, old man,\\r\\nwho can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck\\u2019s body this day week\\r\\nmay sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall\\r\\nI?\\u2014The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails\\r\\nare reefed and set; she heads her course.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man\\u2019s\\r\\ntormented sleep, as if Starbuck\\u2019s voice had caused the long dumb dream\\r\\nto speak.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard\\u2019s arm against the panel;\\r\\nStarbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he\\r\\nplaced the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and\\r\\ntell him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know\\u2019st what to say.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 124. The Needle.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of\\r\\nmighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod\\u2019s gurgling track, pushed\\r\\nher on like giants\\u2019 palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze\\r\\nabounded so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole\\r\\nworld boomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the\\r\\ninvisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;\\r\\nwhere his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned\\r\\nBabylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a\\r\\ncrucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.\\r\\n\\r\\nLong maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time\\r\\nthe tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to eye\\r\\nthe bright sun\\u2019s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly settled\\r\\nby the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun\\u2019s rearward place, and\\r\\nhow the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHa, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot\\r\\nof the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to\\r\\nye! Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards the\\r\\nhelm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cEast-sou-east, sir,\\u201d said the frightened steersman.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThou liest!\\u201d smiting him with his clenched fist. \\u201cHeading East at\\r\\nthis hour in the morning, and the sun astern?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then\\r\\nobserved by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very\\r\\nblinding palpableness must have been the cause.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse\\r\\nof the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost\\r\\nseemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two\\r\\ncompasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the\\r\\nold man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, \\u201cI have it! It has\\r\\nhappened before. Mr. Starbuck, last night\\u2019s thunder turned our\\r\\ncompasses\\u2014that\\u2019s all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I\\r\\ntake it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,\\u201d said the pale\\r\\nmate, gloomily.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than\\r\\none case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as\\r\\ndeveloped in the mariner\\u2019s needle, is, as all know, essentially\\r\\none with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much\\r\\nmarvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning\\r\\nhas actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars\\r\\nand rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more\\r\\nfatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before\\r\\nmagnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife\\u2019s knitting needle.\\r\\nBut in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the\\r\\noriginal virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be\\r\\naffected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;\\r\\neven were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.\\r\\n\\r\\nDeliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed\\r\\ncompasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took\\r\\nthe precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were\\r\\nexactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship\\u2019s course to be\\r\\nchanged accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod\\r\\nthrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair\\r\\none had only been juggling her.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said nothing,\\r\\nbut quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and Flask\\u2014who\\r\\nin some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelings\\u2014likewise\\r\\nunmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some of them lowly\\r\\nrumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear of Fate. But as\\r\\never before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed;\\r\\nor if impressed, it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their\\r\\ncongenial hearts from inflexible Ahab\\u2019s.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But\\r\\nchancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper\\r\\nsight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun\\u2019s pilot! yesterday I wrecked\\r\\nthee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so.\\r\\nBut Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck\\u2014a lance\\r\\nwithout a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker\\u2019s\\r\\nneedles. Quick!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAccessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about\\r\\nto do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to\\r\\nrevive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a\\r\\nmatter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old\\r\\nman well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily\\r\\npracticable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors,\\r\\nwithout some shudderings and evil portents.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMen,\\u201d said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed\\r\\nhim the things he had demanded, \\u201cmy men, the thunder turned old\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his\\r\\nown, that will point as true as any.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAbashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as this\\r\\nwas said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic might\\r\\nfollow. But Starbuck looked away.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the\\r\\nlance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade\\r\\nhim hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the maul,\\r\\nafter repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he placed the\\r\\nblunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly hammered\\r\\nthat, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before. Then\\r\\ngoing through some small strange motions with it\\u2014whether indispensable\\r\\nto the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to augment the awe\\r\\nof the crew, is uncertain\\u2014he called for linen thread; and moving\\r\\nto the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there, and\\r\\nhorizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of the\\r\\ncompass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering and\\r\\nvibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when Ahab,\\r\\nwho had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly\\r\\nback from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,\\r\\nexclaimed,\\u2014\\u201cLook ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the\\r\\nlevel loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nOne after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could\\r\\npersuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk\\r\\naway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his\\r\\nfatal pride.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log\\r\\nand line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance\\r\\nupon other means of determining the vessel\\u2019s place, some merchantmen,\\r\\nand many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave the\\r\\nlog; though at the same time, and frequently more for form\\u2019s sake\\r\\nthan anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate\\r\\nthe course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate\\r\\nof progression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden\\r\\nreel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the\\r\\nrailing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and\\r\\nwind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that\\r\\nhung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he\\r\\nhappened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet scene,\\r\\nand he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his frantic\\r\\noath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing plungingly;\\r\\nastern the billows rolled in riots.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cForward, there! Heave the log!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.\\r\\n\\u201cTake the reel, one of ye, I\\u2019ll heave.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThey went towards the extreme stern, on the ship\\u2019s lee side, where the\\r\\ndeck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into\\r\\nthe creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting\\r\\nhandle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so\\r\\nstood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to him.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty\\r\\nturns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old\\r\\nManxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to\\r\\nspeak.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have\\r\\nspoiled it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled\\r\\nthee? Thou seem\\u2019st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not\\r\\nthou it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey\\r\\nhairs of mine \\u2018tis not worth while disputing, \\u2018specially with a\\r\\nsuperior, who\\u2019ll ne\\u2019er confess.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s that? There now\\u2019s a patched professor in Queen Nature\\u2019s\\r\\ngranite-founded College; but methinks he\\u2019s too subservient. Where wert\\r\\nthou born?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIn the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cExcellent! Thou\\u2019st hit the world by that.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI know not, sir, but I was born there.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIn the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it\\u2019s good. Here\\u2019s\\r\\na man from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned\\r\\nof Man; which is sucked in\\u2014by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind\\r\\nwall butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long\\r\\ndragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In\\r\\nturn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing\\r\\nresistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHold hard!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSnap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the tugging\\r\\nlog was gone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad\\r\\nsea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;\\r\\nreel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and\\r\\nmend thou the line. See to it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere he goes now; to him nothing\\u2019s happened; but to me, the\\r\\nskewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,\\r\\nTahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and\\r\\ndragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip\\u2019s\\r\\nmissing. Let\\u2019s see now if ye haven\\u2019t fished him up here, fisherman.\\r\\nIt drags hard; I guess he\\u2019s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him\\r\\noff; we haul in no cowards here. Ho! there\\u2019s his arm just breaking\\r\\nwater. A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off\\u2014we haul in no cowards here.\\r\\nCaptain Ahab! sir, sir! here\\u2019s Pip, trying to get on board again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cPeace, thou crazy loon,\\u201d cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.\\r\\n\\u201cAway from the quarter-deck!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,\\u201d muttered Ahab,\\r\\nadvancing. \\u201cHands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was,\\r\\nboy?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAstern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils\\r\\nof thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to\\r\\nsieve through! Who art thou, boy?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBell-boy, sir; ship\\u2019s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip!\\r\\nOne hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high\\u2014looks\\r\\ncowardly\\u2014quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who\\u2019s seen Pip\\r\\nthe coward?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens!\\r\\nlook down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned\\r\\nhim, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab\\u2019s cabin shall be Pip\\u2019s\\r\\nhome henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy;\\r\\nthou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let\\u2019s\\r\\ndown.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat\\u2019s this? here\\u2019s velvet shark-skin,\\u201d intently gazing at\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s hand, and feeling it. \\u201cAh, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind\\r\\na thing as this, perhaps he had ne\\u2019er been lost! This seems to me,\\r\\nsir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let\\r\\nold Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one\\r\\nwith the white, for I will not let this go.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse\\r\\nhorrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in\\r\\ngods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods\\r\\noblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not\\r\\nwhat he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come!\\r\\nI feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an\\r\\nEmperor\\u2019s!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere go two daft ones now,\\u201d muttered the old Manxman. \\u201cOne daft\\r\\nwith strength, the other daft with weakness. But here\\u2019s the end of the\\r\\nrotten line\\u2014all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a\\r\\nnew line altogether. I\\u2019ll see Mr. Stubb about it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSteering now south-eastward by Ahab\\u2019s levelled steel, and her progress\\r\\nsolely determined by Ahab\\u2019s level log and line; the Pequod held on\\r\\nher path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such\\r\\nunfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways impelled\\r\\nby unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all these seemed\\r\\nthe strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the\\r\\nEquatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before the\\r\\ndawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch\\u2014then\\r\\nheaded by Flask\\u2014was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and\\r\\nunearthly\\u2014like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all\\r\\nHerod\\u2019s murdered Innocents\\u2014that one and all, they started from their\\r\\nreveries, and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all\\r\\ntransfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild\\r\\ncry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the crew\\r\\nsaid it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers remained\\r\\nunappalled. Yet the grey Manxman\\u2014the oldest mariner of all\\u2014declared\\r\\nthat the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the voices of newly\\r\\ndrowned men in the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelow in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when\\r\\nhe came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not\\r\\nunaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus\\r\\nexplained the wonder.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers\\r\\nof seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or some dams\\r\\nthat had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and kept company\\r\\nwith her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail. But this\\r\\nonly the more affected some of them, because most mariners cherish a\\r\\nvery superstitious feeling about seals, arising not only from their\\r\\npeculiar tones when in distress, but also from the human look of their\\r\\nround heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen peeringly uprising from\\r\\nthe water alongside. In the sea, under certain circumstances, seals have\\r\\nmore than once been mistaken for men.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible\\r\\nconfirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At\\r\\nsun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;\\r\\nand whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for\\r\\nsailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus\\r\\nwith the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he\\r\\nhad not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard\\u2014a cry and a\\r\\nrushing\\u2014and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and\\r\\nlooking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the\\r\\nsea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe life-buoy\\u2014a long slender cask\\u2014was dropped from the stern, where\\r\\nit always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize\\r\\nit, and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that\\r\\nit slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore;\\r\\nand the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if\\r\\nto yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out\\r\\nfor the White Whale, on the White Whale\\u2019s own peculiar ground; that\\r\\nman was swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at\\r\\nthe time. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at\\r\\nleast as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of evil\\r\\nin the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged. They\\r\\ndeclared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had\\r\\nheard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see\\r\\nto it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as\\r\\nin the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of\\r\\nthe voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly\\r\\nconnected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;\\r\\ntherefore, they were going to leave the ship\\u2019s stern unprovided with a\\r\\nbuoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint\\r\\nconcerning his coffin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cA life-buoy of a coffin!\\u201d cried Starbuck, starting.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cRather queer, that, I should say,\\u201d said Stubb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIt will make a good enough one,\\u201d said Flask, \\u201cthe carpenter here\\r\\ncan arrange it easily.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBring it up; there\\u2019s nothing else for it,\\u201d said Starbuck, after\\r\\na melancholy pause. \\u201cRig it, carpenter; do not look at me so\\u2014the\\r\\ncoffin, I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd shall I nail down the lid, sir?\\u201d moving his hand as with a\\r\\nhammer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd shall I caulk the seams, sir?\\u201d moving his hand as with a\\r\\ncaulking-iron.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?\\u201d moving his\\r\\nhand as with a pitch-pot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAway! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin,\\r\\nand no more.\\u2014Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he\\r\\nbaulks. Now I don\\u2019t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he\\r\\nwears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he\\r\\nwon\\u2019t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with\\r\\nthat coffin? And now I\\u2019m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It\\u2019s\\r\\nlike turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side\\r\\nnow. I don\\u2019t like this cobbling sort of business\\u2014I don\\u2019t like it\\r\\nat all; it\\u2019s undignified; it\\u2019s not my place. Let tinkers\\u2019 brats do\\r\\ntinkerings; we are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean,\\r\\nvirgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly\\r\\nbegins at the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to\\r\\nan end at the conclusion; not a cobbler\\u2019s job, that\\u2019s at an end in\\r\\nthe middle, and at the beginning at the end. It\\u2019s the old woman\\u2019s\\r\\ntricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women\\r\\nhave for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with\\r\\na bald-headed young tinker once. And that\\u2019s the reason I never would\\r\\nwork for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\\r\\nVineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run\\r\\noff with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps.\\r\\nLet me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with\\r\\npitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the\\r\\nship\\u2019s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some\\r\\nsuperstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere\\r\\nthey would do the job. But I\\u2019m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I\\r\\ndon\\u2019t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard\\r\\ntray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and\\r\\ncard-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or\\r\\nby the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of\\r\\nour work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if\\r\\nwe can. Hem! I\\u2019ll do the job, now, tenderly. I\\u2019ll have me\\u2014let\\u2019s\\r\\nsee\\u2014how many in the ship\\u2019s company, all told? But I\\u2019ve forgotten.\\r\\nAny way, I\\u2019ll have me thirty separate, Turk\\u2019s-headed life-lines,\\r\\neach three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the\\r\\nhull go down, there\\u2019ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for\\r\\none coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer,\\r\\ncaulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let\\u2019s to it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 127. The Deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the open\\r\\nhatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted oakum\\r\\nslowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his\\r\\nfrock.\\u2014Ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip\\r\\nfollowing him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBack, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand\\r\\ncomplies with my humor more genially than that boy.\\u2014Middle aisle of a\\r\\nchurch! What\\u2019s here?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLife-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck\\u2019s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the\\r\\nhatchway!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cArt not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy\\r\\nshop?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWell enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but\\r\\nthey\\u2019ve set me now to turning it into something else.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,\\r\\nmonopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the\\r\\nnext day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those\\r\\nsame coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a\\r\\njack-of-all-trades.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a\\r\\ncoffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the\\r\\ncraters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in\\r\\nhand. Dost thou never?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I\\u2019m indifferent enough, sir, for that;\\r\\nbut the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because\\r\\nthere was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it.\\r\\nHark to it.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, and that\\u2019s because the lid there\\u2019s a sounding-board; and\\r\\nwhat in all things makes the sounding-board is this\\u2014there\\u2019s naught\\r\\nbeneath. And yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same,\\r\\nCarpenter. Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin\\r\\nknock against the churchyard gate, going in?\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFaith, sir, I\\u2019ve\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFaith? What\\u2019s that?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy, faith, sir, it\\u2019s only a sort of exclamation-like\\u2014that\\u2019s\\r\\nall, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cUm, um; go on.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI was about to say, sir, that\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cArt thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?\\r\\nLook at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in\\r\\nhot latitudes. I\\u2019ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the\\r\\nGallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me\\r\\nsome sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He\\u2019s\\r\\nalways under the Line\\u2014fiery hot, I tell ye! He\\u2019s looking this\\r\\nway\\u2014come, oakum; quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the\\r\\ncork, and I\\u2019m the professor of musical glasses\\u2014tap, tap!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ahab to himself.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s a sight! There\\u2019s a sound! The grey-headed woodpecker\\r\\ntapping the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See!\\r\\nthat thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious\\r\\nwag, that fellow. Rat-tat! So man\\u2019s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial\\r\\nare all materials! What things real are there, but imponderable\\r\\nthoughts? Here now\\u2019s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere\\r\\nhap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered\\r\\nlife. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that\\r\\nin some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an\\r\\nimmortality-preserver! I\\u2019ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in\\r\\nthe dark side of earth, that its other side, the theoretic bright one,\\r\\nseems but uncertain twilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter,\\r\\nwith that accursed sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here\\r\\nwhen I return again. Now, then, Pip, we\\u2019ll talk this over; I do suck\\r\\nmost wondrous philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the\\r\\nunknown worlds must empty into thee!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down\\r\\nupon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the\\r\\ntime the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the\\r\\nbroad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all\\r\\nfell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from\\r\\nthe smitten hull.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBad news; she brings bad news,\\u201d muttered the old Manxman. But ere\\r\\nher commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he\\r\\ncould hopefully hail, Ahab\\u2019s voice was heard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThrottling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;\\r\\nand would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain\\r\\nhimself, having stopped his vessel\\u2019s way, was seen descending her\\r\\nside. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\nmain-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was recognised by\\r\\nAhab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhere was he?\\u2014not killed!\\u2014not killed!\\u201d cried Ahab, closely\\r\\nadvancing. \\u201cHow was it?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while\\r\\nthree of the stranger\\u2019s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales,\\r\\nwhich had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they\\r\\nwere yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby\\r\\nDick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward;\\r\\nwhereupon, the fourth rigged boat\\u2014a reserved one\\u2014had been instantly\\r\\nlowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth\\r\\nboat\\u2014the swiftest keeled of all\\u2014seemed to have succeeded in\\r\\nfastening\\u2014at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell\\r\\nanything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;\\r\\nand then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing\\r\\nmore; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have\\r\\nindefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was\\r\\nsome apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals\\r\\nwere placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her\\r\\nthree far to windward boats\\u2014ere going in quest of the fourth one\\r\\nin the precisely opposite direction\\u2014the ship had not only been\\r\\nnecessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but,\\r\\nfor the time, to increase her distance from it. But the rest of her\\r\\ncrew being at last safe aboard, she crowded all sail\\u2014stunsail on\\r\\nstunsail\\u2014after the missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for\\r\\na beacon; and every other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she\\r\\nhad thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the\\r\\nabsent ones when last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare\\r\\nboats to pull all around her; and not finding anything, had again\\r\\ndashed on; again paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus\\r\\ncontinued doing till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing\\r\\nkeel had been seen.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his\\r\\nobject in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his\\r\\nown in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles\\r\\napart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will wager something now,\\u201d whispered Stubb to Flask, \\u201cthat some\\r\\none in that missing boat wore off that Captain\\u2019s best coat; mayhap,\\r\\nhis watch\\u2014he\\u2019s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard\\r\\nof two pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in\\r\\nthe height of the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he\\r\\nlooks\\u2014pale in the very buttons of his eyes\\u2014look\\u2014it wasn\\u2019t the\\r\\ncoat\\u2014it must have been the\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy boy, my own boy is among them. For God\\u2019s sake\\u2014I beg, I\\r\\nconjure\\u201d\\u2014here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far\\r\\nhad but icily received his petition. \\u201cFor eight-and-forty hours let\\r\\nme charter your ship\\u2014I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for\\r\\nit\\u2014if there be no other way\\u2014for eight-and-forty hours only\\u2014only\\r\\nthat\\u2014you must, oh, you must, and you shall do this thing.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHis son!\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201coh, it\\u2019s his son he\\u2019s lost! I take\\r\\nback the coat and watch\\u2014what says Ahab? We must save that boy.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe\\u2019s drowned with the rest on \\u2018em, last night,\\u201d said the old\\r\\nManx sailor standing behind them; \\u201cI heard; all of ye heard their\\r\\nspirits.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel\\u2019s\\r\\nthe more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of\\r\\nthe Captain\\u2019s sons among the number of the missing boat\\u2019s crew; but\\r\\namong the number of the other boat\\u2019s crews, at the same time, but on\\r\\nthe other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes\\r\\nof the chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the\\r\\nwretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;\\r\\nwhich was only solved for him by his chief mate\\u2019s instinctively\\r\\nadopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,\\r\\nthat is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always\\r\\nto pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown\\r\\nconstitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and\\r\\nnot till forced to it by Ahab\\u2019s iciness did he allude to his one yet\\r\\nmissing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the\\r\\nearnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer\\u2019s paternal love,\\r\\nhad thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a\\r\\nvocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it\\r\\nunfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such\\r\\ntender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years\\u2019\\r\\nvoyage in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge\\r\\nof a whaleman\\u2019s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of\\r\\na father\\u2019s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness\\r\\nand concern.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;\\r\\nand Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without\\r\\nthe least quivering of his own.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will not go,\\u201d said the stranger, \\u201ctill you say aye to me. Do to\\r\\nme as you would have me do to you in the like case. For you too have\\r\\na boy, Captain Ahab\\u2014though but a child, and nestling safely at\\r\\nhome now\\u2014a child of your old age too\\u2014Yes, yes, you relent; I see\\r\\nit\\u2014run, run, men, now, and stand by to square in the yards.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAvast,\\u201d cried Ahab\\u2014\\u201ctouch not a rope-yarn\\u201d; then in a voice\\r\\nthat prolongingly moulded every word\\u2014\\u201cCaptain Gardiner, I will not\\r\\ndo it. Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and\\r\\nmay I forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle\\r\\nwatch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all\\r\\nstrangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,\\r\\nleaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter\\r\\nrejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,\\r\\nGardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his\\r\\nboat, and returned to his ship.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel\\r\\nwas in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,\\r\\nhowever small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung round;\\r\\nstarboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat against a\\r\\nhead sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the while, her\\r\\nmasts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three tall cherry\\r\\ntrees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly saw\\r\\nthat this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without comfort.\\r\\nShe was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were not.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 129. The Cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is\\r\\ncoming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee\\r\\nby him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my\\r\\nmalady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most\\r\\ndesired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,\\r\\nas if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own\\r\\nscrewed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNo, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for\\r\\nyour one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain a\\r\\npart of ye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the\\r\\nfadeless fidelity of man!\\u2014and a black! and crazy!\\u2014but methinks\\r\\nlike-cures-like applies to him too; he grows so sane again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose\\r\\ndrowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.\\r\\nBut I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with\\r\\nye.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIf thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab\\u2019s purpose keels up in\\r\\nhim. I tell thee no; it cannot be.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh good master, master, master!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWeep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.\\r\\nListen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still\\r\\nknow that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!\\u2014Met! True art\\r\\nthou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless\\r\\nthee; and if it come to that,\\u2014God for ever save thee, let what will\\r\\nbefall.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n(Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward.)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHere he this instant stood; I stand in his air,\\u2014but I\\u2019m alone.\\r\\nNow were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he\\u2019s missing. Pip!\\r\\nPip! Ding, dong, ding! Who\\u2019s seen Pip? He must be up here; let\\u2019s try\\r\\nthe door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there\\u2019s no\\r\\nopening it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told\\r\\nme this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I\\u2019ll seat me, against the\\r\\ntransom, in the ship\\u2019s full middle, all her keel and her three masts\\r\\nbefore me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours great\\r\\nadmirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of captains and\\r\\nlieutenants. Ha! what\\u2019s this? epaulets! epaulets! the epaulets all\\r\\ncome crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye; fill up,\\r\\nmonsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy\\u2019s host to white\\r\\nmen with gold lace upon their coats!\\u2014Monsieurs, have ye seen one\\r\\nPip?\\u2014a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and cowardly!\\r\\nJumped from a whale-boat once;\\u2014seen him? No! Well then, fill up again,\\r\\ncaptains, and let\\u2019s drink shame upon all cowards! I name no\\r\\nnames. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table. Shame upon all\\r\\ncowards.\\u2014Hist! above there, I hear ivory\\u2014Oh, master! master! I am\\r\\nindeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here I\\u2019ll stay, though\\r\\nthis stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to\\r\\njoin me.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 130. The Hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a\\r\\npreliminary cruise, Ahab,\\u2014all other whaling waters swept\\u2014seemed to\\r\\nhave chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely\\r\\nthere; now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and\\r\\nlongitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a\\r\\nvessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually\\r\\nencountered Moby Dick;\\u2014and now that all his successive meetings with\\r\\nvarious ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference\\r\\nwith which the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned\\r\\nagainst; now it was that there lurked a something in the old man\\u2019s\\r\\neyes, which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the\\r\\nunsetting polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months\\u2019\\r\\nnight sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab\\u2019s purpose\\r\\nnow fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew.\\r\\nIt domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,\\r\\nfears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a\\r\\nsingle spear or leaf.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,\\r\\nvanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more strove\\r\\nto check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed ground\\r\\nto finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped mortar of\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the deck,\\r\\never conscious that the old man\\u2019s despot eye was on them.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when\\r\\nhe thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that\\r\\neven as Ahab\\u2019s eyes so awed the crew\\u2019s, the inscrutable Parsee\\u2019s\\r\\nglance awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times\\r\\naffected it. Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin\\r\\nFedallah now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked\\r\\ndubious at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a\\r\\nmortal substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some\\r\\nunseen being\\u2019s body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For\\r\\nnot by night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber,\\r\\nor go below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned;\\r\\nhis wan but wondrous eyes did plainly say\\u2014We two watchmen never rest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the\\r\\ndeck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,\\r\\nor exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,\\u2014the\\r\\nmain-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the\\r\\ncabin-scuttle,\\u2014his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;\\r\\nhis hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he\\r\\nstood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung\\r\\nin his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never\\r\\ntell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at\\r\\ntimes; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter, though\\r\\nhe stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and the\\r\\nunheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved coat\\r\\nand hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day\\u2019s sunshine\\r\\ndried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night; he went no\\r\\nmore beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he\\r\\nsent for.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,\\u2014breakfast\\r\\nand dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly\\r\\ngrew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still\\r\\ngrow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But\\r\\nthough his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the\\r\\nParsee\\u2019s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these\\r\\ntwo never seemed to speak\\u2014one man to the other\\u2014unless at long\\r\\nintervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such\\r\\na potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the\\r\\nawe-struck crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced\\r\\nto speak one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned\\r\\nthe slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without\\r\\na single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his\\r\\nscuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each\\r\\nother; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the\\r\\nParsee his abandoned substance.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd yet, somehow, did Ahab\\u2014in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,\\r\\nand every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,\\u2014Ahab\\r\\nseemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both\\r\\nseemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade\\r\\nsiding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel\\r\\nwas solid Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard\\r\\nfrom aft,\\u2014\\u201cMan the mast-heads!\\u201d\\u2014and all through the day, till\\r\\nafter sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at\\r\\nthe striking of the helmsman\\u2019s bell, was heard\\u2014\\u201cWhat d\\u2019ye\\r\\nsee?\\u2014sharp! sharp!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the\\r\\nchildren-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac\\r\\nold man seemed distrustful of his crew\\u2019s fidelity; at least, of nearly\\r\\nall except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether\\r\\nStubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But if\\r\\nthese suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally\\r\\nexpressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI will have the first sight of the whale myself,\\u201d\\u2014he said.\\r\\n\\u201cAye! Ahab must have the doubloon!\\u201d and with his own hands he rigged\\r\\na nest of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single\\r\\nsheaved block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends\\r\\nof the downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared\\r\\na pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done,\\r\\nwith that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked\\r\\nround upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance\\r\\nlong upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then\\r\\nsettling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,\\u2014\\u201cTake the\\r\\nrope, sir\\u2014I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.\\u201d Then arranging his\\r\\nperson in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to\\r\\nhis perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and\\r\\nafterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the\\r\\nroyal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,\\u2014ahead,\\r\\nastern, this side, and that,\\u2014within the wide expanded circle commanded\\r\\nat so great a height.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in\\r\\nthe rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is\\r\\nhoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these\\r\\ncircumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge\\r\\nto some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a\\r\\nwilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft\\r\\ncannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the\\r\\ndeck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes\\r\\ncast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if,\\r\\nunprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some\\r\\ncarelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the\\r\\nsea. So Ahab\\u2019s proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only\\r\\nstrange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one\\r\\nonly man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the\\r\\nslightest degree approaching to decision\\u2014one of those too, whose\\r\\nfaithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat;\\u2014it was\\r\\nstrange, that this was the very man he should select for his watchman;\\r\\nfreely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted\\r\\nperson\\u2019s hands.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\\r\\nminutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\\r\\nincommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\\r\\nlatitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head\\r\\nin a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet\\r\\nstraight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying\\r\\nagain round his head.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\\r\\nnot to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked\\r\\nit much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least\\r\\nheedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every\\r\\nsight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cYour hat, your hat, sir!\\u201d suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who\\r\\nbeing posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though\\r\\nsomewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut already the sable wing was before the old man\\u2019s eyes; the long\\r\\nhooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with\\r\\nhis prize.\\r\\n\\r\\nAn eagle flew thrice round Tarquin\\u2019s head, removing his cap to replace\\r\\nit, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would\\r\\nbe king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen\\r\\naccounted good. Ahab\\u2019s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on\\r\\nand on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;\\r\\nwhile from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was\\r\\ndimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the\\r\\nlife-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably\\r\\nmisnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were\\r\\nfixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships,\\r\\ncross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to\\r\\ncarry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon the stranger\\u2019s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and\\r\\nsome few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you\\r\\nnow saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,\\r\\nhalf-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHast seen the White Whale?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLook!\\u201d replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and\\r\\nwith his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHast killed him?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,\\u201d answered the\\r\\nother, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered\\r\\nsides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNot forged!\\u201d and snatching Perth\\u2019s levelled iron from the crotch,\\r\\nAhab held it out, exclaiming\\u2014\\u201cLook ye, Nantucketer; here in this\\r\\nhand I hold his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are\\r\\nthese barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind\\r\\nthe fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThen God keep thee, old man\\u2014see\\u2019st thou that\\u201d\\u2014pointing to\\r\\nthe hammock\\u2014\\u201cI bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only\\r\\nyesterday; but were dead ere night. Only that one I bury; the rest were\\r\\nburied before they died; you sail upon their tomb.\\u201d Then turning to\\r\\nhis crew\\u2014\\u201cAre ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and\\r\\nlift the body; so, then\\u2014Oh! God\\u201d\\u2014advancing towards the hammock\\r\\nwith uplifted hands\\u2014\\u201cmay the resurrection and the life\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBrace forward! Up helm!\\u201d cried Ahab like lightning to his men.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound\\r\\nof the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not so\\r\\nquick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled\\r\\nher hull with their ghostly baptism.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy\\r\\nhanging at the Pequod\\u2019s stern came into conspicuous relief.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHa! yonder! look yonder, men!\\u201d cried a foreboding voice in her\\r\\nwake. \\u201cIn vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn\\r\\nus your taffrail to show us your coffin!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 132. The Symphony.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were\\r\\nhardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was\\r\\ntransparently pure and soft, with a woman\\u2019s look, and the robust and\\r\\nman-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson\\u2019s\\r\\nchest in his sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\nHither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,\\r\\nunspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;\\r\\nbut to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed\\r\\nmighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,\\r\\ntroubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and\\r\\nshadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,\\r\\nthat distinguished them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle\\r\\nair to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the\\r\\ngirdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion\\u2014most seen\\r\\nhere at the Equator\\u2014denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving\\r\\nalarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.\\r\\n\\r\\nTied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm\\r\\nand unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the\\r\\nashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the\\r\\nmorn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl\\u2019s\\r\\nforehead of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged\\r\\ncreatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how\\r\\noblivious were ye of old Ahab\\u2019s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen\\r\\nlittle Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around\\r\\ntheir old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on\\r\\nthe marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.\\r\\n\\r\\nSlowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side and\\r\\nwatched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the more\\r\\nand the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the lovely\\r\\naromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a moment,\\r\\nthe cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that winsome\\r\\nsky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world, so long\\r\\ncruel\\u2014forbidding\\u2014now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn\\r\\nneck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that\\r\\nhowever wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save\\r\\nand to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into the\\r\\nsea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop.\\r\\n\\r\\nStarbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;\\r\\nand he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that\\r\\nstole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to touch\\r\\nhim, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood there.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab turned.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStarbuck!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On\\r\\nsuch a day\\u2014very much such a sweetness as this\\u2014I struck my first\\r\\nwhale\\u2014a boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty\\u2014forty\\u2014forty years\\r\\nago!\\u2014ago! Forty years of continual whaling! forty years of privation,\\r\\nand peril, and storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty\\r\\nyears has Ahab forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war\\r\\non the horrors of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty\\r\\nyears I have not spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have\\r\\nled; the desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town\\r\\nof a Captain\\u2019s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any\\r\\nsympathy from the green country without\\u2014oh, weariness! heaviness!\\r\\nGuinea-coast slavery of solitary command!\\u2014when I think of all this;\\r\\nonly half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before\\u2014and how for\\r\\nforty years I have fed upon dry salted fare\\u2014fit emblem of the dry\\r\\nnourishment of my soil!\\u2014when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit\\r\\nto his daily hand, and broken the world\\u2019s fresh bread to my mouldy\\r\\ncrusts\\u2014away, whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded\\r\\npast fifty, and sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent\\r\\nin my marriage pillow\\u2014wife? wife?\\u2014rather a widow with her husband\\r\\nalive! Aye, I widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and\\r\\nthen, the madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow,\\r\\nwith which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly\\r\\nchased his prey\\u2014more a demon than a man!\\u2014aye, aye! what a forty\\r\\nyears\\u2019 fool\\u2014fool\\u2014old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of\\r\\nthe chase? why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and\\r\\nthe lance? how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck!\\r\\nis it not hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should\\r\\nhave been snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it\\r\\nblinds me, that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from\\r\\nout some ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I\\r\\nfeel deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering\\r\\nbeneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!\\u2014crack my\\r\\nheart!\\u2014stave my brain!\\u2014mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of\\r\\ngrey hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus\\r\\nintolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into\\r\\na human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to\\r\\ngaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is\\r\\nthe magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;\\r\\nstay on board, on board!\\u2014lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives\\r\\nchase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with the\\r\\nfar away home I see in that eye!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!\\r\\nwhy should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let\\r\\nus fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are\\r\\nStarbuck\\u2019s\\u2014wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow\\r\\nyouth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,\\r\\nlonging, paternal old age! Away! let us away!\\u2014this instant let me\\r\\nalter the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we\\r\\nbowl on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some\\r\\nsuch mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey have, they have. I have seen them\\u2014some summer days in the\\r\\nmorning. About this time\\u2014yes, it is his noon nap now\\u2014the boy\\r\\nvivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of\\r\\ncannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back\\r\\nto dance him again.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201c\\u2018Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every\\r\\nmorning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of his\\r\\nfather\\u2019s sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for Nantucket!\\r\\nCome, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away! See, see! the\\r\\nboy\\u2019s face from the window! the boy\\u2019s hand on the hill!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ahab\\u2019s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook,\\r\\nand cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it;\\r\\nwhat cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor\\r\\ncommands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep\\r\\npushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly\\r\\nmaking me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not\\r\\nso much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this\\r\\narm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy\\r\\nin heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible power;\\r\\nhow then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain think\\r\\nthoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does that\\r\\nliving, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round in\\r\\nthis world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all\\r\\nthe time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon\\r\\nAlbicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where\\r\\ndo murderers go, man! Who\\u2019s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged\\r\\nto the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and\\r\\nthe air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have been\\r\\nmaking hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and the\\r\\nmowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we how\\r\\nwe may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust amid\\r\\ngreenness; as last year\\u2019s scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut\\r\\nswaths\\u2014Starbuck!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut blanched to a corpse\\u2019s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at\\r\\ntwo reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly\\r\\nleaning over the same rail.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 133. The Chase\\u2014First Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat night, in the mid-watch, when the old man\\u2014as his wont at\\r\\nintervals\\u2014stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went\\r\\nto his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing\\r\\nup the sea air as a sagacious ship\\u2019s dog will, in drawing nigh to\\r\\nsome barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that\\r\\npeculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the\\r\\nliving sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner\\r\\nsurprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and\\r\\nthen ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible,\\r\\nAhab rapidly ordered the ship\\u2019s course to be slightly altered, and the\\r\\nsail to be shortened.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated\\r\\nat daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and\\r\\nlengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery\\r\\nwrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift\\r\\ntide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMan the mast-heads! Call all hands!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle\\r\\ndeck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they\\r\\nseemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear\\r\\nwith their clothes in their hands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat d\\u2019ye see?\\u201d cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNothing, nothing sir!\\u201d was the sound hailing down in reply.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cT\\u2019gallant sails!\\u2014stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAll sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for\\r\\nswaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were\\r\\nhoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft,\\r\\nand while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the\\r\\nmain-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the\\r\\nair. \\u201cThere she blows!\\u2014there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It\\r\\nis Moby Dick!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\\r\\nlook-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\\r\\nwhale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\\r\\nperch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\\r\\nbeneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian\\u2019s\\r\\nhead was almost on a level with Ahab\\u2019s heel. From this height the\\r\\nwhale was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea\\r\\nrevealing his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent\\r\\nspout into the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent\\r\\nspout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian\\r\\nOceans.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd did none of ye see it before?\\u201d cried Ahab, hailing the perched\\r\\nmen all around him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\\r\\ncried out,\\u201d said Tashtego.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNot the same instant; not the same\\u2014no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\\r\\nreserved the doubloon for me. I only; none of ye could have raised\\r\\nthe White Whale first. There she blows!\\u2014there she blows!\\u2014there\\r\\nshe blows! There again!\\u2014there again!\\u201d he cried, in long-drawn,\\r\\nlingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the\\r\\nwhale\\u2019s visible jets. \\u201cHe\\u2019s going to sound! In stunsails! Down\\r\\ntop-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay\\r\\non board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady,\\r\\nman, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready\\r\\nthe boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower,\\r\\nlower,\\u2014quick, quicker!\\u201d and he slid through the air to the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHe is heading straight to leeward, sir,\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201cright away\\r\\nfrom us; cannot have seen the ship yet.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBe dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!\\u2014brace up!\\r\\nShiver her!\\u2014shiver her!\\u2014So; well that! Boats, boats!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon all the boats but Starbuck\\u2019s were dropped; all the boat-sails\\r\\nset\\u2014all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\\r\\nleeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\\r\\nFedallah\\u2019s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\\r\\nbut only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\\r\\nstill more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\\r\\nnoon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came\\r\\nso nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump\\r\\nwas distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing,\\r\\nand continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish\\r\\nfoam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head\\r\\nbeyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went\\r\\nthe glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical\\r\\nrippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters\\r\\ninterchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake;\\r\\nand on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But\\r\\nthese were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly\\r\\nfeathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to\\r\\nsome flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall\\r\\nbut shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale\\u2019s\\r\\nback; and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and\\r\\nto and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and\\r\\nrocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\\r\\n\\r\\nA gentle joyousness\\u2014a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\\r\\nthe gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\\r\\nravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\\r\\neyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\\r\\nrippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\\r\\ngreat majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\\r\\ndivinely swam.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn each soft side\\u2014coincident with the parted swell, that but once\\r\\nleaving him, then flowed so wide away\\u2014on each bright side, the whale\\r\\nshed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\\r\\nnamelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\\r\\nto assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\\r\\ntornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\\r\\nwho for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\\r\\nthou may\\u2019st have bejuggled and destroyed before.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\\r\\nwaves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\\r\\nDick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\\r\\nsubmerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\\r\\nBut soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant\\r\\nhis whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia\\u2019s Natural\\r\\nBridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the\\r\\ngrand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly\\r\\nhalting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered\\r\\nover the agitated pool that he left.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the\\r\\nthree boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick\\u2019s reappearance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAn hour,\\u201d said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat\\u2019s stern; and he\\r\\ngazed beyond the whale\\u2019s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide\\r\\nwooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes\\r\\nseemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The\\r\\nbreeze now freshened; the sea began to swell.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe birds!\\u2014the birds!\\u201d cried Tashtego.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\\r\\nnow all flying towards Ahab\\u2019s boat; and when within a few yards began\\r\\nfluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\\r\\nexpectant cries. Their vision was keener than man\\u2019s; Ahab could\\r\\ndiscover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down\\r\\ninto its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than\\r\\na white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as\\r\\nit rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two\\r\\nlong crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the\\r\\nundiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick\\u2019s open mouth and scrolled jaw;\\r\\nhis vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.\\r\\nThe glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\\r\\ntomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\\r\\nthe craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\\r\\nFedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\\r\\nseizing Perth\\u2019s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\\r\\nstand by to stern.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,\\r\\nits bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale\\u2019s head while yet\\r\\nunder water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\\r\\nmalicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself,\\r\\nas it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath\\r\\nthe boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\\r\\nan instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of\\r\\na biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\\r\\nmouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\\r\\nthe open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\\r\\npearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab\\u2019s\\r\\nhead, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\\r\\nnow shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\\r\\nunastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\\r\\ntiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other\\u2019s heads to gain the\\r\\nuttermost stern.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\\r\\nwhale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\\r\\nbody being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\\r\\nthe bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and\\r\\nwhile the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\\r\\nimpossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\\r\\nthis tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\\r\\nhelpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\\r\\nthe long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\\r\\nits gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\\r\\nfrail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\\r\\nenormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain,\\r\\nand locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two\\r\\nfloating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew\\r\\nat the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast\\r\\nto the oars to lash them across.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\\r\\nto perceive the whale\\u2019s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\\r\\nmovement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand\\r\\nhad made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\\r\\nslipping further into the whale\\u2019s mouth, and tilting over sideways as\\r\\nit slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out\\r\\nof it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nRipplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\\r\\ndistance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\\r\\nbillows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\\r\\nso that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose\\u2014some twenty or more\\r\\nfeet out of the water\\u2014the now rising swells, with all their confluent\\r\\nwaves, dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered\\r\\nspray still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled\\r\\nChannel billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly\\r\\nto overleap its summit with their scud.\\r\\n\\r\\n*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation\\r\\n(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down\\r\\npoise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously\\r\\ndescribed. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively\\r\\nview whatever objects may be encircling him.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\\r\\nand round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\\r\\nwake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.\\r\\nThe sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of\\r\\ngrapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus\\u2019s elephants in the book\\r\\nof Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale\\u2019s\\r\\ninsolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,\\u2014though he could\\r\\nstill keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;\\r\\nhelpless Ahab\\u2019s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least\\r\\nchance shock might burst. From the boat\\u2019s fragmentary stern, Fedallah\\r\\nincuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other\\r\\ndrifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to\\r\\nlook to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale\\u2019s\\r\\naspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,\\r\\nthat he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other\\r\\nboats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into\\r\\nthe eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant\\r\\ndestruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case\\r\\ncould they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they\\r\\nremained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now\\r\\nbecome the old man\\u2019s head.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the\\r\\nship\\u2019s mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the\\r\\nscene; and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!\\u2014\\u201cSail\\r\\non the\\u201d\\u2014but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby\\r\\nDick, and whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again,\\r\\nand chancing to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,\\u2014\\u201cSail on the\\r\\nwhale!\\u2014Drive him off!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pequod\\u2019s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,\\r\\nshe effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly\\r\\nswam off, the boats flew to the rescue.\\r\\n\\r\\nDragged into Stubb\\u2019s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white\\r\\nbrine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab\\u2019s bodily\\r\\nstrength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body\\u2019s doom:\\r\\nfor a time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb\\u2019s boat, like one\\r\\ntrodden under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails\\r\\ncame from him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the\\r\\nmore abbreviate it. In an instant\\u2019s compass, great hearts sometimes\\r\\ncondense to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly\\r\\ndiffused through feebler men\\u2019s whole lives. And so, such hearts,\\r\\nthough summary in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it,\\r\\nin their life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of\\r\\ninstantaneous intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those\\r\\nnoble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe harpoon,\\u201d said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on\\r\\none bended arm\\u2014\\u201cis it safe?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\\u201d said Stubb, showing\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLay it before me;\\u2014any missing men?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOne, two, three, four, five;\\u2014there were five oars, sir, and here\\r\\nare five men.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s good.\\u2014Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him!\\r\\nthere! there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!\\u2014Hands off\\r\\nfrom me! The eternal sap runs up in Ahab\\u2019s bones again! Set the sail;\\r\\nout oars; the helm!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\\r\\nup by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus\\r\\ncontinued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But\\r\\nthe added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale,\\r\\nfor he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a\\r\\nvelocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances,\\r\\npushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a\\r\\nhopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an\\r\\nunintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable\\r\\nonly in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it\\r\\nsometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of\\r\\novertaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and\\r\\nwere soon swayed up to their cranes\\u2014the two parts of the wrecked boat\\r\\nhaving been previously secured by her\\u2014and then hoisting everything to\\r\\nher side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching\\r\\nit with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the\\r\\nPequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At the well known,\\r\\nmethodic intervals, the whale\\u2019s glittering spout was regularly\\r\\nannounced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported\\r\\nas just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck,\\r\\nbinnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour\\r\\nexpired, his voice was heard.\\u2014\\u201cWhose is the doubloon now? D\\u2019ye see\\r\\nhim?\\u201d and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to\\r\\nlift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and\\r\\nmotionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,\\r\\nor to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still\\r\\ngreater breadth\\u2014thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at\\r\\nevery turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon\\r\\nthe quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern.\\r\\nAt last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh\\r\\ntroops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man\\u2019s\\r\\nface there now stole some such added gloom as this.\\r\\n\\r\\nStubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to\\r\\nevince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place\\r\\nin his Captain\\u2019s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck\\r\\nexclaimed\\u2014\\u201cThe thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too\\r\\nkeenly, sir; ha! ha!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did\\r\\nI not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could swear\\r\\nthou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, sir,\\u201d said Starbuck drawing near, \\u201c\\u2018tis a solemn sight; an\\r\\nomen, and an ill one.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOmen? omen?\\u2014the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright\\r\\nto man, they will honourably speak outright; not shake their heads, and\\r\\ngive an old wives\\u2019 darkling hint.\\u2014Begone! Ye two are the opposite\\r\\npoles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck;\\r\\nand ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions\\r\\nof the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold\\u2014I\\r\\nshiver!\\u2014How now? Aloft there! D\\u2019ye see him? Sing out for every\\r\\nspout, though he spout ten times a second!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.\\r\\nSoon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCan\\u2019t see the spout now, sir;\\u2014too dark\\u201d\\u2014cried a voice from\\r\\nthe air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHow heading when last seen?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAs before, sir,\\u2014straight to leeward.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGood! he will travel slower now \\u2018tis night. Down royals and\\r\\ntop-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before\\r\\nmorning; he\\u2019s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm\\r\\nthere! keep her full before the wind!\\u2014Aloft! come down!\\u2014Mr.\\r\\nStubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned\\r\\ntill morning.\\u201d\\u2014Then advancing towards the doubloon in the\\r\\nmain-mast\\u2014\\u201cMen, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let\\r\\nit abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye\\r\\nfirst raises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that\\r\\nman\\u2019s; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times\\r\\nits sum shall be divided among all of ye! Away now!\\u2014the deck is thine,\\r\\nsir!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and\\r\\nslouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals\\r\\nrousing himself to see how the night wore on.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 134. The Chase\\u2014Second Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cD\\u2019ye see him?\\u201d cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the\\r\\nlight to spread.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSee nothing, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTurn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought\\r\\nfor;\\u2014the top-gallant sails!\\u2014aye, they should have been kept on her\\r\\nall night. But no matter\\u2014\\u2018tis but resting for the rush.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHere be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale,\\r\\ncontinued through day into night, and through night into day, is a thing\\r\\nby no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is the\\r\\nwonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence\\r\\nacquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;\\r\\nthat from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they\\r\\nwill, under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both\\r\\nthe direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of\\r\\nsight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.\\r\\nAnd, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of\\r\\na coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires\\r\\nshortly to return to again, but at some further point; like as this\\r\\npilot stands by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the\\r\\ncape at present visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright\\r\\nthe remote, unseen headland, eventually to be visited: so does the\\r\\nfisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for after being chased, and\\r\\ndiligently marked, through several hours of daylight, then, when night\\r\\nobscures the fish, the creature\\u2019s future wake through the darkness\\r\\nis almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the\\r\\npilot\\u2019s coast is to him. So that to this hunter\\u2019s wondrous skill,\\r\\nthe proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water, a wake, is to all\\r\\ndesired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land. And as the\\r\\nmighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in\\r\\nits every pace, that, with watches in their hands, men time his rate as\\r\\ndoctors that of a baby\\u2019s pulse; and lightly say of it, the up train or\\r\\nthe down train will reach such or such a spot, at such or such an hour;\\r\\neven so, almost, there are occasions when these Nantucketers time that\\r\\nother Leviathan of the deep, according to the observed humor of his\\r\\nspeed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence this whale will have\\r\\ngone two hundred miles, will have about reached this or that degree of\\r\\nlatitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at all successful\\r\\nin the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman\\u2019s allies; for\\r\\nof what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill\\r\\nthat assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from\\r\\nhis port? Inferable from these statements, are many collateral subtile\\r\\nmatters touching the chase of whales.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a\\r\\ncannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level\\r\\nfield.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBy salt and hemp!\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201cbut this swift motion of the\\r\\ndeck creeps up one\\u2019s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I\\r\\nare two brave fellows!\\u2014Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me,\\r\\nspine-wise, on the sea,\\u2014for by live-oaks! my spine\\u2019s a keel. Ha, ha!\\r\\nwe go the gait that leaves no dust behind!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere she blows\\u2014she blows!\\u2014she blows!\\u2014right ahead!\\u201d was now\\r\\nthe mast-head cry.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye!\\u201d cried Stubb, \\u201cI knew it\\u2014ye can\\u2019t escape\\u2014blow on\\r\\nand split your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow\\r\\nyour trump\\u2014blister your lungs!\\u2014Ahab will dam off your blood, as a\\r\\nmiller shuts his watergate upon the stream!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies\\r\\nof the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine\\r\\nworked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might\\r\\nhave felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the\\r\\ngrowing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,\\r\\nas timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand\\r\\nof Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of\\r\\nthe previous day; the rack of the past night\\u2019s suspense; the fixed,\\r\\nunfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging\\r\\ntowards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled\\r\\nalong. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the\\r\\nvessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of\\r\\nthat unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;\\r\\nthough it was put together of all contrasting things\\u2014oak, and maple,\\r\\nand pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp\\u2014yet all these ran into each\\r\\nother in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and\\r\\ndirected by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of\\r\\nthe crew, this man\\u2019s valor, that man\\u2019s fear; guilt and guiltiness,\\r\\nall varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that\\r\\nfatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were\\r\\noutspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one\\r\\nhand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,\\r\\nshading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking\\r\\nyards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for\\r\\ntheir fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to\\r\\nseek out the thing that might destroy them!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhy sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\\u201d cried Ahab, when,\\r\\nafter the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been\\r\\nheard. \\u201cSway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts\\r\\none odd jet that way, and then disappears.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some\\r\\nother thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for\\r\\nhardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its\\r\\npin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the\\r\\nair vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant\\r\\nhalloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as\\u2014much nearer to the ship\\r\\nthan the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead\\u2014Moby Dick\\r\\nbodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\\r\\nby the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White\\r\\nWhale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon\\r\\nof breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths,\\r\\nthe Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of\\r\\nair, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the\\r\\ndistance of seven miles and more. In those moments, the torn, enraged\\r\\nwaves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases, this breaching is his\\r\\nact of defiance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThere she breaches! there she breaches!\\u201d was the cry, as in his\\r\\nimmeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\\r\\nHeaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\\r\\nagainst the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for\\r\\nthe moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\\r\\nstood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling\\r\\nintensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\\u201d cried Ahab, \\u201cthy\\r\\nhour and thy harpoon are at hand!\\u2014Down! down all of ye, but one man at\\r\\nthe fore. The boats!\\u2014stand by!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nUnmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like\\r\\nshooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and\\r\\nhalyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from\\r\\nhis perch.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLower away,\\u201d he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat\\u2014a\\r\\nspare one, rigged the afternoon previous. \\u201cMr. Starbuck, the ship is\\r\\nthine\\u2014keep away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\\r\\nassailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\\r\\nthree crews. Ahab\\u2019s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told\\r\\nthem he would take the whale head-and-head,\\u2014that is, pull straight\\r\\nup to his forehead,\\u2014a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain\\r\\nlimit, such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale\\u2019s\\r\\nsidelong vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all\\r\\nthree boats were plain as the ship\\u2019s three masts to his eye; the White\\r\\nWhale churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as\\r\\nit were, rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail,\\r\\noffered appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted\\r\\nat him from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each\\r\\nseparate plank of which those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred,\\r\\nincessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for\\r\\na while eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank\\u2019s breadth; while\\r\\nall the time, Ahab\\u2019s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to\\r\\nshreds.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\\r\\nand recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\\r\\nlines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\\r\\nwarped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\\r\\nfor a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\\r\\ntremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\\r\\nline: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again\\u2014hoping\\r\\nthat way to disencumber it of some snarls\\u2014when lo!\\u2014a sight more\\r\\nsavage than the embattled teeth of sharks!\\r\\n\\r\\nCaught and twisted\\u2014corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose\\r\\nharpoons and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came\\r\\nflashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab\\u2019s boat.\\r\\nOnly one thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically\\r\\nreached within\\u2014through\\u2014and then, without\\u2014the rays of steel;\\r\\ndragged in the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and\\r\\nthen, twice sundering the rope near the chocks\\u2014dropped the intercepted\\r\\nfagot of steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the\\r\\nWhite Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other\\r\\nlines; by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of\\r\\nStubb and Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two\\r\\nrolling husks on a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the\\r\\nsea, disappeared in a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the\\r\\nodorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round, like the\\r\\ngrated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\\r\\nthe revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\\r\\naslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his\\r\\nlegs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily\\r\\nsinging out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man\\u2019s\\r\\nline\\u2014now parting\\u2014admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\\r\\nrescue whom he could;\\u2014in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\\r\\nconcreted perils,\\u2014Ahab\\u2019s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\\r\\nHeaven by invisible wires,\\u2014as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\\r\\nfrom the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\\r\\nbottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\\r\\nagain\\u2014gunwale downwards\\u2014and Ahab and his men struggled out from\\r\\nunder it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first uprising momentum of the whale\\u2014modifying its direction as\\r\\nhe struck the surface\\u2014involuntarily launched him along it, to a little\\r\\ndistance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his\\r\\nback to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\\r\\nside to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip\\r\\nor crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\\r\\ncame sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work\\r\\nfor that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\\r\\nocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\\r\\nleeward way at a traveller\\u2019s methodic pace.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\\r\\ncame bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\\r\\nfloating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and\\r\\nsafely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and\\r\\nankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable\\r\\nintricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there;\\r\\nbut no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As\\r\\nwith Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to\\r\\nhis boat\\u2019s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor\\r\\ndid it so exhaust him as the previous day\\u2019s mishap.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\\r\\ninstead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\\r\\nStarbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\\r\\nleg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye, Starbuck, \\u2018tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who\\r\\nhe will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe ferrule has not stood, sir,\\u201d said the carpenter, now coming up;\\r\\n\\u201cI put good work into that leg.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut no bones broken, sir, I hope,\\u201d said Stubb with true concern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!\\u2014d\\u2019ye see it.\\u2014But even\\r\\nwith a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone\\r\\nof mine one jot more me, than this dead one that\\u2019s lost. Nor white\\r\\nwhale, nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own\\r\\nproper and inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast\\r\\nscrape yonder roof?\\u2014Aloft there! which way?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDead to leeward, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cUp helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest\\r\\nof the spare boats and rig them\\u2014Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the\\r\\nboat\\u2019s crews.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLet me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\\r\\nunconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSir?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane\\u2014there, that\\r\\nshivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet.\\r\\nBy heaven it cannot be!\\u2014missing?\\u2014quick! call them all.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe old man\\u2019s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the\\r\\nParsee was not there.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe Parsee!\\u201d cried Stubb\\u2014\\u201che must have been caught in\\u2014\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe black vomit wrench thee!\\u2014run all of ye above, alow, cabin,\\r\\nforecastle\\u2014find him\\u2014not gone\\u2014not gone!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was\\r\\nnowhere to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, sir,\\u201d said Stubb\\u2014\\u201ccaught among the tangles of your\\r\\nline\\u2014I thought I saw him dragging under.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMy line! my line? Gone?\\u2014gone? What means that little word?\\u2014What\\r\\ndeath-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.\\r\\nThe harpoon, too!\\u2014toss over the litter there,\\u2014d\\u2019ye see it?\\u2014the\\r\\nforged iron, men, the white whale\\u2019s\\u2014no, no, no,\\u2014blistered fool!\\r\\nthis hand did dart it!\\u2014\\u2018tis in the fish!\\u2014Aloft there! Keep him\\r\\nnailed\\u2014Quick!\\u2014all hands to the rigging of the boats\\u2014collect the\\r\\noars\\u2014harpooneers! the irons, the irons!\\u2014hoist the royals higher\\u2014a\\r\\npull on all the sheets!\\u2014helm there! steady, steady for your life!\\r\\nI\\u2019ll ten times girdle the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight\\r\\nthrough it, but I\\u2019ll slay him yet!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGreat God! but for one single instant show thyself,\\u201d cried\\r\\nStarbuck; \\u201cnever, never wilt thou capture him, old man\\u2014In Jesus\\u2019\\r\\nname no more of this, that\\u2019s worse than devil\\u2019s madness. Two days\\r\\nchased; twice stove to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from\\r\\nunder thee; thy evil shadow gone\\u2014all good angels mobbing thee with\\r\\nwarnings:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat more wouldst thou have?\\u2014Shall we keep chasing this murderous\\r\\nfish till he swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the\\r\\nbottom of the sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh,\\r\\noh,\\u2014Impiety and blasphemy to hunt him more!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStarbuck, of late I\\u2019ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since\\r\\nthat hour we both saw\\u2014thou know\\u2019st what, in one another\\u2019s eyes.\\r\\nBut in this matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the\\r\\npalm of this hand\\u2014a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab,\\r\\nman. This whole act\\u2019s immutably decreed. \\u2018Twas rehearsed by thee\\r\\nand me a billion years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates\\u2019\\r\\nlieutenant; I act under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest\\r\\nmine.\\u2014Stand round me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump;\\r\\nleaning on a shivered lance; propped up on a lonely foot. \\u2018Tis\\r\\nAhab\\u2014his body\\u2019s part; but Ahab\\u2019s soul\\u2019s a centipede, that moves\\r\\nupon a hundred legs. I feel strained, half stranded, as ropes that\\r\\ntow dismasted frigates in a gale; and I may look so. But ere I break,\\r\\nye\\u2019ll hear me crack; and till ye hear that, know that Ahab\\u2019s hawser\\r\\ntows his purpose yet. Believe ye, men, in the things called omens? Then\\r\\nlaugh aloud, and cry encore! For ere they drown, drowning things will\\r\\ntwice rise to the surface; then rise again, to sink for evermore. So\\r\\nwith Moby Dick\\u2014two days he\\u2019s floated\\u2014tomorrow will be the third.\\r\\nAye, men, he\\u2019ll rise once more,\\u2014but only to spout his last! D\\u2019ye\\r\\nfeel brave men, brave?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAs fearless fire,\\u201d cried Stubb.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAnd as mechanical,\\u201d muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he\\r\\nmuttered on: \\u201cThe things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same\\r\\nto Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I\\r\\nseek to drive out of others\\u2019 hearts what\\u2019s clinched so fast\\r\\nin mine!\\u2014The Parsee\\u2014the Parsee!\\u2014gone, gone? and he was to go\\r\\nbefore:\\u2014but still was to be seen again ere I could perish\\u2014How\\u2019s\\r\\nthat?\\u2014There\\u2019s a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by\\r\\nthe ghosts of the whole line of judges:\\u2014like a hawk\\u2019s beak it pecks\\r\\nmy brain. I\\u2019ll, I\\u2019ll solve it, though!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as\\r\\non the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the\\r\\ngrindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by lanterns\\r\\nin the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening\\r\\ntheir fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken keel of\\r\\nAhab\\u2019s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still\\r\\nas on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle;\\r\\nhis hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat\\r\\ndue eastward for the earliest sun.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 135. The Chase.\\u2014Third Day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the\\r\\nsolitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the\\r\\ndaylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cD\\u2019ye see him?\\u201d cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cIn his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that\\u2019s all.\\r\\nHelm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely\\r\\nday again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to\\r\\nthe angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a\\r\\nfairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here\\u2019s food for thought,\\r\\nhad Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels,\\r\\nfeels; that\\u2019s tingling enough for mortal man! to think\\u2019s audacity.\\r\\nGod only has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a\\r\\ncoolness and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains\\r\\nbeat too much for that. And yet, I\\u2019ve sometimes thought my brain was\\r\\nvery calm\\u2014frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in\\r\\nwhich the contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is\\r\\ngrowing now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it\\u2019s\\r\\nlike that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the\\r\\nearthy clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds\\r\\nblow it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash\\r\\nthe tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere\\r\\nthis through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and\\r\\nventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.\\r\\nOut upon it!\\u2014it\\u2019s tainted. Were I the wind, I\\u2019d blow no more on\\r\\nsuch a wicked, miserable world. I\\u2019d crawl somewhere to a cave, and\\r\\nslink there. And yet, \\u2018tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who\\r\\never conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.\\r\\nRun tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that\\r\\nstrikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.\\r\\nEven Ahab is a braver thing\\u2014a nobler thing than that. Would now the\\r\\nwind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage\\r\\nmortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects,\\r\\nnot as agents. There\\u2019s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most\\r\\nmalicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that\\r\\nthere\\u2019s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm\\r\\nTrade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in\\r\\nstrong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,\\r\\nhowever the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest\\r\\nMississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go\\r\\nat last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly\\r\\nblow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them\\u2014something\\r\\nso unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it!\\r\\nAloft there! What d\\u2019ye see?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNothing, sir.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cNothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!\\r\\nAye, aye, it must be so. I\\u2019ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,\\r\\nhe\\u2019s chasing me now; not I, him\\u2014that\\u2019s bad; I might have known it,\\r\\ntoo. Fool! the lines\\u2014the harpoons he\\u2019s towing. Aye, aye, I have run\\r\\nhim by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular\\r\\nlook outs! Man the braces!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSteering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod\\u2019s\\r\\nquarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced\\r\\nship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own\\r\\nwhite wake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAgainst the wind he now steers for the open jaw,\\u201d murmured Starbuck\\r\\nto himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. \\u201cGod\\r\\nkeep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside\\r\\nwet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStand by to sway me up!\\u201d cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen\\r\\nbasket. \\u201cWe should meet him soon.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, aye, sir,\\u201d and straightway Starbuck did Ahab\\u2019s bidding, and\\r\\nonce more Ahab swung on high.\\r\\n\\r\\nA whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held\\r\\nlong breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the\\r\\nweather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the three\\r\\nmast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced\\r\\nit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cForehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck\\r\\nthere!\\u2014brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind\\u2019s eye. He\\u2019s too\\r\\nfar off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that\\r\\nhelmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But\\r\\nlet me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there\\u2019s\\r\\ntime for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and\\r\\nnot changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of\\r\\nNantucket! The same!\\u2014the same!\\u2014the same to Noah as to me. There\\u2019s\\r\\na soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead\\r\\nsomewhere\\u2014to something else than common land, more palmy than the\\r\\npalms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward,\\r\\nthen; the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old\\r\\nmast-head! What\\u2019s this?\\u2014green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped\\r\\ncracks. No such green weather stains on Ahab\\u2019s head! There\\u2019s the\\r\\ndifference now between man\\u2019s old age and matter\\u2019s. But aye, old\\r\\nmast, we both grow old together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not,\\r\\nmy ship? Aye, minus a leg, that\\u2019s all. By heaven this dead wood has\\r\\nthe better of my live flesh every way. I can\\u2019t compare with it; and\\r\\nI\\u2019ve known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men\\r\\nmade of the most vital stuff of vital fathers. What\\u2019s that he said?\\r\\nhe should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But\\r\\nwhere? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend\\r\\nthose endless stairs? and all night I\\u2019ve been sailing from him,\\r\\nwherever he did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told\\u2019st direful\\r\\ntruth as touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell\\r\\nshort. Good-bye, mast-head\\u2014keep a good eye upon the whale, the while\\r\\nI\\u2019m gone. We\\u2019ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale\\r\\nlies down there, tied by head and tail.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHe gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered\\r\\nthrough the cloven blue air to the deck.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop\\u2019s\\r\\nstern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the\\r\\nmate,\\u2014who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck\\u2014and bade him pause.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStarbuck!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSir?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cFor the third time my soul\\u2019s ship starts upon this voyage,\\r\\nStarbuck.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cAye, sir, thou wilt have it so.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSome ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,\\r\\nStarbuck!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cTruth, sir: saddest truth.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cSome men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the\\r\\nflood;\\u2014and I feel now like a billow that\\u2019s all one crested comb,\\r\\nStarbuck. I am old;\\u2014shake hands with me, man.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck\\u2019s tears the glue.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh, my captain, my captain!\\u2014noble heart\\u2014go not\\u2014go not!\\u2014see,\\r\\nit\\u2019s a brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion\\r\\nthen!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cLower away!\\u201d\\u2014cried Ahab, tossing the mate\\u2019s arm from him.\\r\\n\\u201cStand by the crew!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe sharks! the sharks!\\u201d cried a voice from the low cabin-window\\r\\nthere; \\u201cO master, my master, come back!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the\\r\\nboat leaped on.\\r\\n\\r\\nYet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when\\r\\nnumbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath\\r\\nthe hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time they\\r\\ndipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with their\\r\\nbites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats in\\r\\nthose swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in\\r\\nthe same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching\\r\\nregiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that had been\\r\\nobserved by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first descried;\\r\\nand whether it was that Ahab\\u2019s crew were all such tiger-yellow\\r\\nbarbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the\\r\\nsharks\\u2014a matter sometimes well known to affect them,\\u2014however it was,\\r\\nthey seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHeart of wrought steel!\\u201d murmured Starbuck gazing over the side,\\r\\nand following with his eyes the receding boat\\u2014\\u201ccanst thou yet ring\\r\\nboldly to that sight?\\u2014lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and\\r\\nfollowed by them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical\\r\\nthird day?\\u2014For when three days flow together in one continuous intense\\r\\npursuit; be sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the\\r\\nthird the evening and the end of that thing\\u2014be that end what it may.\\r\\nOh! my God! what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly\\r\\ncalm, yet expectant,\\u2014fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim\\r\\nbefore me, as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow\\r\\ngrown dim. Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I\\r\\nseem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life\\r\\nseem clearing; but clouds sweep between\\u2014Is my journey\\u2019s end coming?\\r\\nMy legs feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy\\r\\nheart,\\u2014beats it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!\\u2014stave it off\\u2014move,\\r\\nmove! speak aloud!\\u2014Mast-head there! See ye my boy\\u2019s hand on the\\r\\nhill?\\u2014Crazed;\\u2014aloft there!\\u2014keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:\\u2014\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cMark well the whale!\\u2014Ho! again!\\u2014drive off that hawk! see! he\\r\\npecks\\u2014he tears the vane\\u201d\\u2014pointing to the red flag flying at the\\r\\nmain-truck\\u2014\\u201cHa! he soars away with it!\\u2014Where\\u2019s the old man now?\\r\\nsee\\u2019st thou that sight, oh Ahab!\\u2014shudder, shudder!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the\\r\\nmast-heads\\u2014a downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had\\r\\nsounded; but intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his\\r\\nway a little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining\\r\\nthe profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered\\r\\nagainst the opposing bow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cDrive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads\\r\\ndrive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and no\\r\\nhearse can be mine:\\u2014and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSuddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then\\r\\nquickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of\\r\\nice, swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a\\r\\nsubterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with\\r\\ntrailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,\\r\\nbut obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it\\r\\nhovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back\\r\\ninto the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for\\r\\nan instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of\\r\\nflakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the\\r\\nmarble trunk of the whale.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cGive way!\\u201d cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward\\r\\nto the attack; but maddened by yesterday\\u2019s fresh irons that corroded\\r\\nin him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that\\r\\nfell from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his\\r\\nbroad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted\\r\\ntogether; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and\\r\\nonce more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the\\r\\ntwo mates\\u2019 boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their\\r\\nbows, but leaving Ahab\\u2019s almost without a scar.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the\\r\\nwhale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he\\r\\nshot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and\\r\\nround to the fish\\u2019s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,\\r\\nduring the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines\\r\\naround him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment\\r\\nfrayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe harpoon dropped from his hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBefooled, befooled!\\u201d\\u2014drawing in a long lean breath\\u2014\\u201cAye,\\r\\nParsee! I see thee again.\\u2014Aye, and thou goest before; and this, this\\r\\nthen is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last\\r\\nletter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the\\r\\nship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and\\r\\nreturn to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die\\u2014Down, men! the first thing\\r\\nthat but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I\\r\\nharpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey\\r\\nme.\\u2014Where\\u2019s the whale? gone down again?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the\\r\\ncorpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had\\r\\nbeen but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily\\r\\nswimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,\\u2014which thus far had\\r\\nbeen sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present\\r\\nher headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost\\r\\nvelocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the\\r\\nsea.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOh! Ahab,\\u201d cried Starbuck, \\u201cnot too late is it, even now, the\\r\\nthird day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou,\\r\\nthat madly seekest him!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nSetting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to\\r\\nleeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding by\\r\\nthe vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck\\u2019s face as he\\r\\nleaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow\\r\\nhim, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he\\r\\nsaw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\\r\\nmast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\\r\\nwhich had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\\r\\nrepairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped,\\r\\nhe also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves\\r\\non deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he\\r\\nheard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving\\r\\na nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or\\r\\nflag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had\\r\\njust gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer\\r\\nand nails, and so nail it to the mast.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether fagged by the three days\\u2019 running chase, and the resistance\\r\\nto his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some\\r\\nlatent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White\\r\\nWhale\\u2019s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly\\r\\nnearing him once more; though indeed the whale\\u2019s last start had not\\r\\nbeen so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves\\r\\nthe unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to the\\r\\nboat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades became\\r\\njagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at almost\\r\\nevery dip.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cHeed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars.\\r\\nPull on! \\u2018tis the better rest, the shark\\u2019s jaw than the yielding\\r\\nwater.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cBut at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThey will last long enough! pull on!\\u2014But who can tell\\u201d\\u2014he\\r\\nmuttered\\u2014\\u201cwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on\\r\\nAhab?\\u2014But pull on! Aye, all alive, now\\u2014we near him. The helm! take\\r\\nthe helm! let me pass,\\u201d\\u2014and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him\\r\\nforward to the bows of the still flying boat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along\\r\\nwith the White Whale\\u2019s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its\\r\\nadvance\\u2014as the whale sometimes will\\u2014and Ahab was fairly within the\\r\\nsmoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale\\u2019s spout, curled\\r\\nround his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,\\r\\nwith body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the\\r\\npoise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the\\r\\nhated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked\\r\\ninto a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his nigh\\r\\nflank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so suddenly\\r\\ncanted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated part of the\\r\\ngunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have been tossed\\r\\ninto the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen\\u2014who foreknew not the\\r\\nprecise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for its\\r\\neffects\\u2014these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two of\\r\\nthem clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a combing\\r\\nwave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man helplessly\\r\\ndropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,\\r\\ninstantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering\\r\\nsea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with\\r\\nthe line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their\\r\\nseats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line\\r\\nfelt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cWhat breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!\\u2014\\u2018tis whole again; oars!\\r\\noars! Burst in upon him!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nHearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled\\r\\nround to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,\\r\\ncatching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing\\r\\nin it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it\\u2014it may be\\u2014a\\r\\nlarger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing\\r\\nprow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.\\r\\n\\r\\nAhab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. \\u201cI grow blind; hands!\\r\\nstretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is\\u2019t night?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe whale! The ship!\\u201d cried the cringing oarsmen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cOars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for\\r\\never too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see:\\r\\nthe ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the\\r\\nsledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks\\r\\nburst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat\\r\\nlay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying\\r\\nhard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego\\u2019s mast-head hammer\\r\\nremained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as\\r\\nwith a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own\\r\\nforward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the\\r\\nbowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon\\r\\nas he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers\\r\\nof air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a\\r\\nwoman\\u2019s fainting fit. Up helm, I say\\u2014ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is\\r\\nthis the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?\\r\\nOh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up\\r\\nhelm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on\\r\\ntowards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me\\r\\nnow!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cStand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now\\r\\nhelp Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning\\r\\nwhale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb\\u2019s own\\r\\nunwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is\\r\\nall too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee, thou\\r\\ngrinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins of\\r\\nas good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would yet\\r\\nring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh! thou\\r\\ngrinning whale, but there\\u2019ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye\\r\\nnot, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in\\r\\nhis drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;\\u2014cherries!\\r\\ncherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cCherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope\\r\\nmy poor mother\\u2019s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will\\r\\nnow come to her, for the voyage is up.\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the ship\\u2019s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive;\\r\\nhammers, bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in\\r\\ntheir hands, just as they had darted from their various employments;\\r\\nall their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to\\r\\nside strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of\\r\\noverspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,\\r\\nswift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of\\r\\nall that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead\\r\\nsmote the ship\\u2019s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some\\r\\nfell flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the\\r\\nharpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,\\r\\nthey heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cThe ship! The hearse!\\u2014the second hearse!\\u201d cried Ahab from the\\r\\nboat; \\u201cits wood could only be American!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nDiving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its\\r\\nkeel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far\\r\\noff the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab\\u2019s boat, where, for a\\r\\ntime, he lay quiescent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u201cI turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy\\r\\nhammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked\\r\\nkeel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm,\\r\\nand Pole-pointed prow,\\u2014death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and\\r\\nwithout me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked\\r\\ncaptains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel my topmost\\r\\ngreatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your furthest\\r\\nbounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone life,\\r\\nand top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll, thou\\r\\nall-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with thee;\\r\\nfrom hell\\u2019s heart I stab at thee; for hate\\u2019s sake I spit my last\\r\\nbreath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!\\r\\nand since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still\\r\\nchasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! Thus, I give up\\r\\nthe spear!\\u201d\\r\\n\\r\\nThe harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting\\r\\nvelocity the line ran through the grooves;\\u2014ran foul. Ahab stooped\\r\\nto clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the\\r\\nneck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was\\r\\nshot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the\\r\\nheavy eye-splice in the rope\\u2019s final end flew out of the stark-empty\\r\\ntub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its\\r\\ndepths.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor an instant, the tranced boat\\u2019s crew stood still; then turned.\\r\\n\\u201cThe ship? Great God, where is the ship?\\u201d Soon they through dim,\\r\\nbewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous\\r\\nFata Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by\\r\\ninfatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the\\r\\npagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.\\r\\nAnd now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its\\r\\ncrew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning, animate\\r\\nand inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the smallest\\r\\nchip of the Pequod out of sight.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the\\r\\nsunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the\\r\\nerect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,\\r\\nwhich calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying\\r\\nbillows they almost touched;\\u2014at that instant, a red arm and a hammer\\r\\nhovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing\\r\\nthe flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that\\r\\ntauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home\\r\\namong the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;\\r\\nthis bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the\\r\\nhammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill,\\r\\nthe submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his hammer frozen\\r\\nthere; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic shrieks, and his\\r\\nimperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive form folded in the\\r\\nflag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like Satan, would not sink\\r\\nto hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her, and\\r\\nhelmeted herself with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen white\\r\\nsurf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the great\\r\\nshroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEpilogue \\u201cAND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE\\u201d Job.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe drama\\u2019s done. Why then here does any one step forth?\\u2014Because one\\r\\ndid survive the wreck.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt so chanced, that after the Parsee\\u2019s disappearance, I was he whom\\r\\nthe Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab\\u2019s bowsman, when that\\r\\nbowsman assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the\\r\\nthree men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern.\\r\\nSo, floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of\\r\\nit, when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then,\\r\\nbut slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had\\r\\nsubsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting\\r\\ntowards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling\\r\\ncircle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital\\r\\ncentre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of\\r\\nits cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great\\r\\nforce, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and\\r\\nfloated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day\\r\\nand night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks,\\r\\nthey glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks\\r\\nsailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer,\\r\\nand picked me up at last. It was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in\\r\\nher retracing search after her missing children, only found another\\r\\norphan.'"

She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name.
